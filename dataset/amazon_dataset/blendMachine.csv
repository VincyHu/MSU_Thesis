5,Terrific Blender!,3-Dec-17,Yes,"<div class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"" id=""video-block-R3UC3MMKGTW2LU""></div><input class=""video-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1z4HE4OYKS.mp4""/><input class=""video-slate-img-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91P1E6J9sOS.png""/>??Just received my Blendtec and I am so pleased with it!.Other reviewers said that it was LOUD. While it is loud, it's just as loud as any other blender. I did not find it especially disruptive. The noisiest part was at the beginning of the cycle when it was blending the frozen fruit. Also reviewers said that the lid flew off when blending. I'm guessing they did not have the lid fastened on properly. On the four sides of the lid are little lips that click onto the jar to keep it in place - which is why it takes me a second to take off the lid in the video..I used the smoothie setting and it made a very consistent and delicious drink! I could still feel the texture of the raspberry seeds, but I think that's to be expected. I was skeptical that a drop of dish-soap and water would clean all the seeds off the side of the jar, but it WORKED! So happy to have such an easy clean-up!.I also used the hot soup setting with some lentil soup I had in the fridge. In 3 mins that soup was steaming! I'm not much of a fan of pureed soups, but if you do like them that setting is awesome! I'm looking forward to making hot cider!.It fits perfectly under my kitchen cabinets!.Registering the blender was super easy on the Blendtec website. I simply had to find the serial number on the bottom of the blender and fill out a form. Amazon is one of their registered stores, so the warranty is effective for 8 years! The user manual is less than terrific - it includes very basic instructions and only a few recipes. I checked out their website though and there are TONS of great looking recipes!.Very happy with my purchase!.EDITED AFTER 1 MONTH:.I wanted to add a couple things I've noticed after some use. First, make sure to always clean it RIGHT AWAY otherwise things get stuck on and it isn't pretty. Sometimes I still need to use a sponge to get some seeds off. Also I've found it has trouble with too much frozens, so try to use a mix of frozen and fresh items!.If you found my review helpful, please click Yes below!",202
1,Don't order this through Amazon,8-Jul-17,Yes,"I've received two defective Blendtec blenders in a row from Amazon. The first one's motor didn't work at all, the second one (replaced the first one) burnt out after about three uses. Either amazon is shipping out all the defective ones, or Blendtec is selling the ones that failed quality control through amazon.",116
5,I finally found my Juicer and so much more,4-Dec-16,Yes,"First I didn't receive a discount or any perks from the company for this review. I'm active duty military and just want to help some people out;-)..Bought this product with the included wild side jar for $238 on cyber Monday, and took the ""nutribullet"" back to Best Buy...Reason I bought:.1. I like making my own juice with whole fruit for me and the family. I have a juicer, but it's cumbersome, messy, you get a small amount of juice, and a lot of pulp on the other side for disposal etc. I needed a better option cause I felt I was loosing all the valuable nutrients from the pulp; and it's a pain in the butt to prep the fruit for juicing along with the cleanup is ???????? (had this product for a couple of years)..2. Bought a nutribullet and it was good. I was able to get more juice from whole fruit, but it left a bit too much pulp to be broken down. More like a smoothie with pulp than juice as far as consistency ( if that's your thing then the nutribullet will be a great option) Kids didn't care for that too much, and neither did I..Bottom line up front (BLUF) The nutribullet worked good, but left a bit too much pulp when using it to juice. (had this product for 1 month and took it back to Best Buy)..3. The blentec total blender with the wild side jar was on sale for $237 ( now $367????) on cybermonday. I bought it due to the $237 ( wife approved) price point and salesman at bestbuy stating all the advantages of this product and the videos showed the consistency of actual juice $300+ at Best Buy . I was ""iffy"" due to the reviews, but took the plunge. This product is great and gets all the fruit into a nice juice consistency with very minimal pulp (if any). It's like the consistency of the naked fruit drinks but maybe a little thinner consistency depending on what fruit you add and how much water. ( I add approximately a half ""measuring cup"" of water per batch; and I fill about 1/2 to 3/4 full of fruit)..I passed on it initially due to the current price, but if I knew how this product performed or had one in the house to review prior to buying...it would have been a no brainier. ( I've had this product for 1 week now) I'll update in a few months to review for longevity of use, and other uses ( soups, smoothies, etc) Hope this helps someone.",79
5,"I've had my eye on getting a nice blender, and I went with Blendtec over Vitamix",20-Dec-16,Yes,"I've had my eye on getting a nice blender, and I went with Blendtec over Vitamix.  Everyone will have their preference, but I went with Blendtec because I've seen how durable they are.  I worked at Starbucks for almost 12 years, and not once did I see a Blendtec go out.  We abused those things so badly: throwing pitchers in the sink, slamming the blades on the rinser, seeing liquid creep into the motor housing.  The pitcher style pours so easily, the base is short enough to fit under my cabinets, and everything blends so smoothly.  It's not quiet, but blenders really shouldn't be.  Only thing I'd like is an additional lid without a feeder hole... occasionally liquid sneaks out of that top gap in the lid, but overall not a deal breaker.  Easy to clean.",49
5,Cleans easy and it works with just a push of a button.,10-Dec-17,Yes,"I bought mine on November 29th for $210 with tax...Like everyone else I was tying to decide between this and a Vitamix. I watched some YouTube videos,I read some reviews here and then the $190 price point finally convinced me. The other factors were the height of the product and the blade shape. It does fit places better and the blade eliminates the need to have to push ingridents down all the time.I didn?€?t want another blender where I had to push crap down...I had an Oster that I used before and I hated the fact that I kept feeling the fruit seeds, I also had to push things down and stop every 15 seconds because the motor was smelling burnt...Blendtec is not louder then your current one, whichever one your using. Is as loud as any other. Also, it runs for 1 minute for every smoothie. Not enough time to drive you nuts...Cleaning it is the best thing ever, compared to the old one where I had to unscrew the blade and the rubber sealing and wash. This one you just need a drop of dish soap and 7 seconds. Also is dishwasher safe...The smoothies come out supe smooth and you can only feel 10% of the seeds when you are making a mixed berry smoothie, compared with the 80% from my previous one...It does have al this technology incorporated where each preset had the speed down to the second so it speeds up and down accordingly. Love that...We bought it for smoothies, every other presets are just perks. I?€?m curious about the ice cream one,.I never tried it and I?€?m scheptical but I?€?ll update...If this blender is going to work for at least 5 years on an almost everyday use...I?€?m a fan. I never tried vitamix but the reviews convinced me that this was a better choice for my needs.",44
1,Quality is worried,1-Apr-18,Yes,"I bought this blender about tow month ago, the usage frequency is about one or twice a week. Today when i after blending a milkshake, a little black plastic chip leaking from bottom if the machine. I wondered what it was, and when i gentlly shaked the machine, i could hear the sound of some other dropped items inside the machine. So i opened the bottom cap with a screwdriver, excactly there were two more scrapes dropped from the bottom fan blakes. The quality is so worried even two months passed. I do request a replacement at least.",29
1,DO NOT BUY,31-Aug-18,Yes,"Very unhappy with Blendtec. We bought this in December 2017 and the motor broke down completely after 2 months of use. We called and they sent us a new motor. We have been trying to use it but it doesn't work like it used to. It is now very loud and we can't use it when our kids are sleeping. Also, it doesn't blend frozen fruit anymore. Just non frozen items. We called tech support again and he was extremely rude and said there is nothing he can do and our blender is supposed to make noise that loud. He said it needs to have 32 oz of water no matter what the recipe and that we weren't using it right. We did not have these issues before the motor broke down the first time so we know this isn't true. Right now our $25 blender works better than the Blendec. I would go with either the Ninja or the Vitamix in the future.",20
1,"this is poor jar, used less 5 times the fruit juice ...",28-Nov-17,Yes,"<div class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"" id=""video-block-RIMDANJD4QI82""></div><input class=""video-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1i6f5NMocS.mp4""/><input class=""video-slate-img-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1JM-hwF0PS.png""/>??this is poor jar,used less 5 times the fruit juice leaks from the bottom..",38
4,"Want to like this but jar leaked at bottom, first blend.",21-Jan-18,Yes,"Nice idea here, nice design...but what is up with the leaking bottom problem with the jar?? I got this for $179, cannot believe the high regular price for this and it comes with a leaky jar?? I have an OLD Hamilton Beach blender, just recently got into making smoothies. The HB, no leaks.  Upped my game to a high quality blender...maybe...As always, AMAZON comes through and is sending a replacement, two day shipping. No problem there. Have a feeling this could be a chronic issue with this Blendtec jar as I have read more on web on this. Did not reach out to Blendtec yet because customer service closed on weekend.  I do not mind paying up for a quallity product but it better work properly and last...Update 1/23/18:  I received the new Blendtec Total Blender from Amazon and so far so good.  No leak at the bottom of the jar.  I also spoke to a very helpful Blendtec customer service rep.  I told her the story and she said it was likely I might have received an older model jar and they have in fact upgraded (something about a new silicon type seal at the bottom) the jar because of the known leaking problem.  I had this conversation with her prior to me trying the second jar out.  I asked her what the proper course of action would be if the second jar leaked.  She reiterated the 8 year warranty, top to bottom, and said they would replace the second jar, no question.  She said their engineers are always interested in these problems and work to fix these issues...Blendtec customer service was excellent.  Owned the problem and offered the fix, no hesitation at all.  Of course this gave me (and possibly you) peace of mind with laying out this kind of money for a blender.  Four stars from two, not enough time/uses to give it a full five stars.",16
1,Leaking water,6-Feb-18,Yes,The Blendtec was broken when we received it. This was not from shipping but from the manufacturer. The gasket was leaking water like other reviews have mentioned. We returned to Amazon with no issues but are still disappointed. We are gonna go with Vitamix instead now. Wish Blendtec would fix their issues.,22
5,I love the Blendtec,2-Apr-18,Yes,"I will never use another blender (not even the personal name brand one).  I love the Blendtec.  If you make green smoothies, and use anything other than this blender, you will certainly see the difference.  I made one in the Ninja personal smoothie machine, and there were little chunks in there, and it was not at all as smooth as the Blendtec makes it.  I think one of my favorite features is that you can use whole fruit, and make whole fruit juice.  It's not really a 'juice' as it still has all the fiber and everything left in tact, it's more of a velvety smooth puree.  I will  take a bunch of grapefruits, or oranges and peel them, put them in the blender and hit the whole juice function.  I then freeze it into ice cube grays, and pop a few of them into a glass of sparkling water.  I don't like to drink juice, but I love that I can drink 'whole fruit' this way.  It's a very versatile appliance in that you can do just about anything in it.",7
5,My Blentec Blender is everything I was looking for.,2-Dec-16,Yes,"I've always owned a Ninja Professional blender because the price was not as expensive as most other ones. After years of being unhappy with my smoothie or shake consistency I started looking at other options only to realize that the price is signifcantlh more. I have been comparing the Blentec &amp; Vitamix for over a year now via internet reviews &amp; YouTube when finally, a deal of a lifetime happened on Cyber Monday. The deal was so good, I couldn't resist living without a Blendtec Blender any longer.  My husband pulled the plug and bought me this Blendtec for an early Christmas gift and I couldn't be more pleased. After all of these years I now own a blender I am proud of. The price is right, the blends are amazing and the Blendtec hit the mark for texture on my shakes and smoothies. I know I will use this product daily so I knew I needed ease of cleaning and this Blendtec Total blender is so easy to clean-- I love it! More things I love about this Blendtec Total Blender is that it's not too loud and it fits with ease under my cabinets. Amazing product! So worth a little extra money. I am now a happy camper when it comes to juices, shakes and smoothies-- I cannot wait to try all the amazing things this blender can do!",21
1,"Not durable, spend your money elsewhere.",23-Feb-17,Yes,"Less than 350 uses, 3 years old the blade mechanism in the Jar ($100 to replace) locked up against the plastic during a blend, started smoking like crazy. Buttons on it aren't particularly reliable so had to unplug the machine to stop it from grinding. Scary when something with this kind of power starts to catch fire....Waste your money elsewhere.",13
5,Great Blender &amp; GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE !!  (owned blender for almost 2 years),13-Aug-15,Yes,"I bought this blender in Sept. 2013, I've had it for almost 2 yrs. now. I use it everyday for a green smoothie. I love it, I never have any chunks, blends ingredients beautifully.  I started to notice a black oil being sprayed under the pitcher after each use. It had been happening for awhile &amp; I thought it was due to the high speed and lubrication from motor. I called customer service, spoke with a wonderful customer service representative  I explained what was happening &amp; she said the pitcher needed to be replaced. She proceeded to ask a few questions and said I'd have my new pitcher within 10 days. I did not have to pay to have it replaced, boy was I pleased. I payed a lot for this blender &amp; I expect it to last. The pitcher didn't &amp; the company is taking care of it. I read a few other reviews stating the customer service was not the greatest. I'm writing a review mainly about Blendtec's customer service, because I thought it was so GREAT.  Oh, I do love my blender too!!!",16
5,Buying this product worth each and every penny,29-Jul-18,Yes,"A truly Total Blender..The Blendtec Total Blender really does it all. You?€?ve probably seen the unique square jar design before, but until you use it you won?€?t know the power of the blending vortex that the shape creates...The power..This industry-leading 1,560 watt motor cranks out up to 3 horsepower! Plenty to propel that 4 inch blade to annihilate whatever is inside...The capacity..The three quart BPA-free jar is large enough for nearly any job; even soup for a large dinner party is no problem for this blender...The versatility.Maybe the best way to think about a high-performance blender is to not think about it as a blender at all. It?€?s more of a counter-top appliance replacement...With all of the different tasks it can handle, it really is so much more. The Blendtec Total Blender ticks all the boxes of what a high-performance blender should be...If you make bread or bake, the Total Blender is large enough to replace your mixing bowl for making dough...Your soups will be creamier than ever...Turn ice into snow and wow your friends with incredible margaritas...When fruit is at peak ripeness, make it into creamy ice cream and you can savor it then, or save it for another time...The BPA-free jar means you can make delicious food for your baby, worry-free...The list goes on and on; dressings, sauces, salsas, cappuccinos, hummus, nut butter, you?€?ll never run out of uses for a high performance blender...The convenience.The best thing about having a high-performance blender in your kitchen is the convenience. Quite simply, having one means that healthy, delicious meals can be prepared in no time at all. A number of features make most high-performance blenders hassle-free, and the Total Blender delivers on all counts...It?€?s small enough to stay on your kitchen counter beneath the cupboards, or store below in the cabinets. The fixed blade makes the blender safe, but also means no more dealing with screwing on loose parts. The Blendtec is always assembled...Once you have it out, just add your ingredients and select one of the pre-programmed blend cycles. The blender will slow down, speed up and stop on it?€?s own giving you the exact result every time whether you?€?re making a smoothie or baby food. It?€?s a great time saver that let?€?s you get other things done while the blender does its thing...Cleanup is always the dreaded part of hauling out the blender, but with the Total Blender it?€?s a breeze. Just add water and a little dish soap, blend it for a few seconds, then take it over to the sink and rinse it. It really couldn?€?t be easier to clean. The flat panel design is easy to wipe off when there are any spills on the base. There are no buttons for small scraps to lodge under...Drawbacks..By far the biggest issue consumers have with the Blendtec Total Blender is that it is loud. Of course with all of the power it has, it?€?s essentially unavoidable, still, it?€?s important to be aware of this before buying. Especially if you plan on using it while people sleep...Another complaint is that the base is heavy when compared to a conventional blender. This is also unavoidable, to house such a powerful motor, and be safe to use, the 5.6 pounds of metal and quality material is a necessity...One other thing that some purchasers notice is the inevitable scratching inside the jar. Because it?€?s plastic, this will happen over time. The scratches won?€?t be deep, and the jar will still clean just fine, it?€?s mostly an aesthetic consideration. The only way to avoid this is with a glass jar, but glass is actually less durable and there are no good high-performance blenders that offer it...The Total Blender comes with the ?€?WildSide Jar?€? which gives it its unique blending vortex. It also includes the Twister jar which allows you to scrape the sides with a twist of the lid while blending ?€? an important feature when making something sticky like homemade peanut butter. It?€?s also great for individual servings. For sticking in the WildSide Jar, the included Spectacula Spatula is designed especially for the Total Blender...The Fresh Blends Cookbook features over 200 pages of recipes so you?€?ll never run out of ideas for great, healthy meals and snacks. And of course, the Blendtec comes standard with a manufacturer 8 year limited warranty, a welcome reassurance after making a significant investment in a high-performance blender.",3
3,a long awaited disappointment :(,18-Apr-13,Yes,"I researched between the blendtec and vitamix for 2 years..It's sufficient. But for that price... I wanted BAM!.Pros-.It's better than the crap blenders..The cycle buttons are great..The display is pretty and I like to see how many cycles it has gone through..I like the heavy duty cord..It is a beautiful blender. Looks gorgeous in the kitchen..It costs less than the vitamix. (for good reason, methinks).Cons-.It costs more than it ought to, considering the following:.I loaded the ingredients in the suggested way (liquid first, soft food, hard food/frozen/ice) and I use the appropriate cycle. And.. I still get piece and chunks. I can cope with that, but I was buying this blender so I DID NOT HAVE TO COPE with chunky smoothies. I don't want grape skins in my smoothies that are identifiable. I do not want to see tiny pieces of apple skins. Today my smoothie had full on piece of frozen peach! Small pieces, but... it was not a smooth smoothie after all..It is loud. (I know vitamix is too. It's just a con of all good blenders).It came with a tiny little scratch on the face of the button/display panel. This made me sad, even though it is cosmetic..**I have had this blender &gt;one month, and use it several times a day. Smoothies. Salsa. Soup. Ice cream..The smoothies I always have to run through the smoothie cycle AND then run it a second TIME or push the pulse button until my smoothie is just that, smooth. I had a couple of smoothies come out luke warm because I had to process them too long in the blender!.The soup came out warm and mostly smooth. The salsa worked well..I made icecream worked pretty well..I wish the canister was stainless steel or glass!..If I had it to do over again I would go with the vitamix, because the quality would be worth coughing up 100.00+ more dollars for how much I use my blender, it would pay for itself quickly..All in all I can get by with this one for now, but if you're battling the ""vitamix vs blendtec"" war in your head like I was, let me say I tried to be practical and still get quality. I got a measure of quality to save some money. I would not make that choice again.",31
3,package is not original,27-Jul-17,Yes,"I like the product. But the package box is not original manufacture box, and it's in shipping cardboard box. I bought a new product not refurbished , so I request Amazon to change a new one to me. Amazon customer service was good, but they replaced me exact same one without manufacture box.  Since the blender works well, I don't bother to change. However, the package makes me think the product is refurbished not brand new.",22
3,Seemed to work pretty well for the last couple of months,9-Jul-18,Yes,"Seemed to work pretty well for the last couple of months.  However the small jar would vibrate wildly and would have to hold it down as to it not to topple off the base.  Then it had overflowed for no apparent reason after filling it to the middle with cold ingredients.  Today no power.  Ugh, I really hate that items die in a matter of a couple of months when spending close to $200 for this machine.",4
1,VERY bad customer service,24-Jun-15,Yes,"I would NOT recommend this blender. Not because of the blender itself but because of the customer service. I purchased this Blendtec 2 years ago and it had become increasingly louder and louder, to the point that it was abrasive to the entire family each time it was used. It supposedly has an 8 year warranty and I called 2 weeks ago to request help or replacement for my Blendtec. It was astounding the run around I got. I was told I would get a new replacement and then it took 2 plus weeks to arrive. When it did - it was not new but ""refurbished"" without the jar. I had returned my original/loud Blendtec, with the jar included. I was then told it would take at least another 2 weeks to get the jar. They also told me there was no way my jar, their error, could be expedited. So, all in all, over a month without the blender (which I use 4-5 times a week), lots of phone calls and e-mails and each contact resulted in new and different information. The time and energy spent was over the top. Every time I called or e-mailed the company the information would change. I am in the health care industry and recommended Blendtec to my clients. In addition, I frequently bought Blendtecs as gifts for friends and family. I will no longer promote this company  or purchase any more of their products. They do not honor their loyal customers and either knowingly create layers of aggravation or do not appropriately train their customer service staff. Either way, it is such a disappointment. I will be looking into a Vitamix and other brands. I encourage you to shop around.",35
1,My wife and I purchased this price of crap blender on Feb,20-Mar-18,Yes,"My wife and I purchased this price of crap blender on Feb. 6, 2018 and have already had to contact blend tech to have them send me TWO replacement jars before mid March!... The first jar the blade became loose and would NOT spin to chop vegetables and the second one the company sent had a leak at the bottom of the jar the FIRST time of useage. I am EXTREMLY disappointed because of all the hype behind this crap tech, I mean blend tech. Now I have to spend MORE MONEY because of the return window JUST so happen to close March 8th. I will NEVER purchase ANYTHING from the company Blend tech again. VITAMIX HERE I COME!",20
5,I'm very happy with this blender!,17-Feb-18,Yes,"I'm very happy with this blender.  I've now put it through its paces and it has performed perfectly for my needs.  I've made lots of easy-blending ingredients and dishes:  for example,  chopped nuts and creamy dips, but also smoothies.  I don't use ice cubes in my smoothies, but I do use frozen berries and frozen bananas (buy a bunch, put one into today's smoothie, and immediately freeze the rest in chunks for the rest of the week), and the ""smoothie"" setting figures it all out.  The container is small, so I make 2 days' smoothies at a time: it's important to factor in the size of the container to your cooking needs.  I don't put hot soups in a plastic blender.  I'm ancient and often wish I had my late-60's Waring glass container with 3 simple speed buttons.....however, I'm okay with the Blendtec:  I had to read the manual to figure out the icons, but the settings work and everything I've made has turned out perfectly.  And--I don't care how fancy your blender is, but you've got to keep your hand on the lid when it's blending--and the very best tamper is whatever tool you use when the motor is turned off.  Finally,  I was delighted to buy on a  pre-Christmas deal, because  I paid only $189.99.",8
5,Five stars! Just be sure to buy some headphones as this baby is powerful.,19-Feb-14,Yes,"It's expensive, so I debated buying this for several days. But I was enjoying the health benefits of using a nutriblast for a few months and wanted something more powerful. I'm glad I invested in this. It does everything! It IS loud; it sounds like a motrocycle revving up. That's why I went to a local home supply store and bought the type of headphones people use when riding lawn mowers. I want to preserve my hearing. I paid 19$ for the headphones and they work perfectly for this level of noise..If you are looking for a first class POWERFUL blender, this is it. And it's so easy to clean. Forget the naysayers; this is great and worth every penny..UPDATE:.I've used this 240 times and I am still absolutely delighted with this purchase. I've discovered that I can make FRESH V-8 juice in two minutes (2 salad tomatoes (they're cheaper than the other ones), 1 large carrot - cut in one inch pieces, celery heart or a handful of Kale or spinach, a dash of salt, tabasco, etc. (according to your taste), 3/4 cup cold water, 5 ice cubes,  blend on WHOLE JUICE setting and in 50 seconds, you have the freshest veggie drink you've probably ever had! Always put the liquid in first, then the soft veggies then the hard veggies and ice. remember: liquid first, then soft, then hard ingredients..I've also discovered that you should only use the smoothie setting for soft fruits and leafy greens. If you put hard veggies in (like carrots or frozen broccoli florets) you should use the whole juice setting..I'm eating the healthiest diet I have ever eaten in my life! I used to run from vegetables. Now, I love seeing how many broccoli florets, how much kale and spinach, etc, I can cram into my smoothies..Do I feel better?.Yes. I'm so regular now that I don't need any additional fiber. I feel a definite difference (in vitality and clearheadedness) on the mornings when I have even a small green smoothie..Here's another great light pick-me-up: one nectarine pitted and cut in pieces, two carrots cut in one inch pieces, an apple cored (remove core) and quartered, a tsp of stevia sweetener, a cup of cold water, and a few ice cubes. Blend on WHOLE JUICE and get ready for a delicious drink..How easily does this clean? Simple. Put two cups of warm water in it with a drop of dish detergent. Press pulse for 2-3 seconds. Rinse. That's all there is to it! The only removable part is the lid, not the blades (which are built in)..If you love your Nutriblast, you are going to be ecstatic over this. But DO BUY SOME NOISE REDUCTION EARMUFFS! THIS IS LOUD..UPDATE October 10, 2014. I'm up to 730 uses of this and it is still going as strong as the day that I bought it. I have eaten more vegetables and fruits (via smoothies) in the last few months than I have in the last five years. It has made a significant improvement in my overall health. Recommended.",36
3,Good Warranty - Jar died.,21-Mar-16,Yes,"Seal in jar died a while back.  I thought the build up in the bottom portion of jar that hooks onto motor was from water left over in the bottom of the jar but it was stuff leaking through. It is now bad enough that it is clear that stuff was leaking through.  I didn't realize till I started researching the problem that the jar and blade are factory sealed so you can't just tighten something - that was another thought I had but hadn't followed up on.  They also mention that the jar leaking into the motor area can kill the motor and void the motor warranty.  I've had the blendtec since late 2011 so 4 years of making drinks - we've made somewhere around 205 based on the counter...They are sending me the wildside jar for $20 as an upgrade with the jar being warrantied.  Could have had the 4 sided jar for free.  I am just suppose to throw out the old jar once the new one comes.  I've never put the jar in the dishwasher.  One thing they do mention is to manually spin the blade in the jar before using it.  They also mentioned not holding the lid down.  Two things which I wasn't doing properly before.  I am not sure I was always loading it correctly, liquid first then hard things, either...The 5 sided jar is supposed to be quite a bit better with a larger blade that puts less pressure/wear on the bearings/shaft.  There would have been 1 less star if I had to fork out $150 for a new jar.  There would have been 1 more star if there was no problem to begin with.",11
5,Love My Blendtec Total Blender,10-Jun-13,Yes,"I have been through several traditional blenders using them for basic blending purposes and wanted to step it up to the next level and try juicing which led me to look at the Blendtec. It was highly recommended on many juicing sites I looked at. I thought, ""no, I can't spend that much on a blender"". I tried a couple of others and ended up returning them because my vegetable juices were pulpy and chunky even after pulsing waaay over the normal time suggested. I did some more research and saw so many recommendations for the Blendtec, many saying the same thing I am saying here...it does the job perfectly and more (making sauces, nut butters, soups, mixes dough and even makes ice-cream.) All you have to do is press the button for whatever you are making, and it does the rest within a short time. It is quite loud, but not for long as it starts out slow and works up to a high speed then stops automatically when the job is complete. A 10-year old could do it. (With supervision, of course). Most importantly, it IS worth the money spent. The electronic monitor tells you exactly how many time you have used it...not necessary for my purposes, but I suppose those that use it in smoothie shops may use this. Yes, I understand this is a favorite for commercial use as well, but I'm sure they opt for a higher priced heavy duty model. This one is perfect for my use. The clean-up is easy...rinse, pop out the lid insert and put it all in the dishwasher. After using daily for a month, it looks as new as the day I took it out of the box. Take time to read the description and how each jar is used. This simple cook, found it all fascinating. Blendtec helps you understand how the vortex construction works with different ingredients and while you may get by with just the main set-up, to maximize the success of the different things you can make, such as mixing dough and making ice-cream, you may want to consider the other jars as well.  Overall, I couldn't be happier and wish I had gotten a Blendtec years ago!  My favorite ""perk"" has to be the fact that the bottom is all intact... no need to unscrew and clean caps or rubber seals or risk the leakage that can occur with traditional blenders. If I were young and creating my Bridal Registry, this would be at the top of the list!",7
5,Will it blend? Yes,24-May-17,Yes,"Figured I would try this out after watching many of the quirky ""Will it blend?"" youtube videos, though, I don't plan on making anything inedible with this blender...This blender is very powerful! And very loud! Can be an overkill for some basic blending, but the difference is noticeable. So far I have made a bean dip, and smoothies/milkshakes. No more worrying about not being able to blend lots of ice, frozen fruit (and random household items &amp; electronic devices?!? :D )  No complaints with the FourSide jar, easy to handle and clean. Also, 8 year warranty is nice...I bought it on sale for $237. Still a lot more than your typical budget blender, but long term wise, you'll be able to do much more, especially if you plan to utilize this making a variety of meals.",2
5,THE. BEST. BLENDER.,15-Dec-17,Yes,"Seriously, THE. BEST. BLENDER. My wife would tell me about the Blendtec and how supossedly great it was. I was skepitcal. Then, we found it on sale during Cyber Monday and decided to take the plunge. It is well worth the price whether on sale or not. It makes creamy smoothies and blends to a level that I have no experienced with my traditional kitchen blender or my other mini-health smoothie blenders...I would buy again, and will buy a replacement if one is ever needed.",2
5,"Three years, going strong",14-Apr-12,Yes,"I've had the unit for several years now, use it several times a day.  So far, 3800 'uses' per the counter built-in, which includes the 'cleaning' cycles, and sometimes rerunning a cycle (for soups, to heat up), or sometimes running it twice for some smoothies with a lot of material...Basically, we love it.  It's probably the best appliance we have.  I have experimented with Vitamix, and other blenders.  This is the best for size, cleaning, and overall use...We use it primarily for smooothies, nut milks, and soups.  We also use other appliances where needed like juicers and food processors since they have their place in a raw food kitchen...We tend to fill the blender pretty high (4-5 cups), so we have to be careful with the lid.  It has been blown off on a few occasions due to the high speed liquids, so holding the lid on during certain specific cycles is advisable.  It does throw the liquid high and far, and will coat walls, ceiling, pets, and people with ease...The blender is loud, and will wake the dead, so the morning smoothie isn't needed to wake you up - the sound alone from this blender will do that.  One could buy the commercial blender with the sound dampening case, but it's pretty pricey (well above that of the pricey blender)...I also recommend getting the larger size pitcher (I think it's called the Wild Side?), especially if you are making smoothies for more than 1-2 people.  Getting 5 cups or so out of the blender is nice.  The standard size one is probably a cup or two less.  You can buy an extra pitcher later on if you want it as an 'upgrade'...When I burn this one out, I'll be buying another, for sure.",9
5,BEST kitchen appliance,21-Jan-14,Yes,"I love my Blendtec.  It is a fantastic appliance, which I use daily.  After researching the differences between the Vita-mix and Blendtec, I chose the Blendtec, mainly b/c of the 4 sided shape, which is suppose to allow the ingredients to rotate through the blender and achieve a more consistent blend without having to use a spoon or plunger to mix things up.  After using it for several months, I love it even more, as my kids are eating more fruits and veggies through smoothies.  Because the powerful motor is able to blend the items more thoroughly than my Cuisinart Blender was able to, even seeds in raspberries and blackberries are indiscernible.  I recently discovered that the Vita-mix does not have the handy, pre-programmed buttons that the Blendtec does, that allow you to choose a setting and even continue working on other things in the kitchen while the Blender does it's job.  For instance, my smoothie button will move through different power settings to properly blend ingredients but without over doing it, and then turns off when the smoothie is done.  It also has preprogrammed settings for soup, ice cream, shakes, etc.  It's expensive, but the cheaper versions, just can't compete!",5
5,Awesome blender,19-Nov-18,Yes,I did not think I would spend 200 on a blender but this is an awesome blender and cheaper than even costco. I bought the wildside jar for 110 on amazon. so got blender and 3 jars for 300 and that is about what it is at costco with one jar and sometimes has the deal with 2 jars..It blends great makes smoothies awesome auto shutoff digital timer and so on. The cheap blenders just cannot compare and with 8 year warranty you will go through 3-4 for 50 dollar blenders before this one goes out.,0
5,Your best blender investment.,28-Jan-16,Yes,"Simply the BEST!!.I did my fare share of different other blenders - from cheap to expensive. USELESS!.I am proud that this blender is made in the U.S., and it's designed with functionality and durability in mind. It's also cute, doesn't take space on the counter and can change your life by providing you with the opportunity to make healthy and delicious shakes, and meals every day. Think of this product as your best investment and reward.",4
4,Very good bang for your buck!,28-Jan-18,Yes,"Pre-set settings that corresponds with what we need to do, super easy to clean, good all around quality in all the components. For the price this has the most poweful motor at 1500+Watts..The only thing that is a little uncertain is the warranty period. The owners manual makes no mention of a time period and the seller mentioned a 7 year warranty. I will look into this with the seller to see if they can send me a confirmation.",3
1,Fuming!!! DOA! Dead on Arrival,9-Sep-18,Yes,"I'm so incredibly PO'd. The wife and I was just talking about how much we liked her cousin's.blendtec and decided to get one so I did some research on Amazon. A few days later and BAM!!! Deal of the Day so I immediately ordered it.  I get it today (Sun Sept 9). I unbox it, read he instructions, unpack it, plug it it and NOTHING. The display turns on but the motor doesn't move period! Trying each button out and all the display says is ""overload"". I look in troubleshooting and it doesn't say much on how to clear the code. I unplug, wait for a few min, turn it back on, still no motor movement..this sucksasssssssss! Is it a refurb or what?",3
5,Smooth green smoothies!,10-Mar-18,Yes,You want a very smooth smoothie this is the machine for you!  I blend green smoothies with no hint of fiber taste. The fiber is there. If u let it sit in fridge it still rises to the top but when you drink it you can?€?t tast any chunks. I need to buy the bigger pitcher as well. Only thing is I wish they had a glass pitcher option.,1
5,Amazing blender!,23-Sep-13,Yes,"I was surprised to see that the blades are blunted.  Don't worry about blades every getting dull, they are supposed to be dull!  the duller the better.  This thing uses raw power to obliterate anything you put in the jar.  I am very impressed...I've had this for about 18 months now and have run about 300 cycles on it (it shows you on the LCD how many you've run).  I mostly use it for smoothies and other drinks.  I've tried making soup too, and it works but I think there are quieter ways of making soup!..It's pretty loud, but hey, its a blender.  The biggest reason I bought this over the Vita Mix is height.  The Blendtec easily fits under your kitchen cabinets.  The Vita Mix does not.  Also, the Vita Mix looks like it's from the 1970s.",5
5,2 &amp; 1/2 years and going strong!!,15-Dec-13,Yes,"If you're going to invest in a powerful, high performance blender, you'll likely be choosing between two brands: Blentec and Vitamix.  I think it's safe to say that both company's make an excellent product.  They match up pretty evenly in most areas.  Here are the difference i found and the things that made me choose the Blendtec:..- The Vitamix has the ability to go about 30% faster, but the Blendtec is about 30% more powerful.  I thought going for the power made the most sense..-The Vitamix has manual controls, the Blendtec electronic.  I like one touch ease of the Blendtec  It has a timer so you can see how many more seconds till your smoothie is done, then it turns off automatically..-And for me BEST thing is the Blendtec, at 15 1/2"" tall, fits right under the cabinets.  The Vitamix is 20"", that's 7 &amp;12/ inches taller!  I use it a few times a week so I appreciate easy access to it.  The Vitamix has a shorter version now but it is over $600, even at Amazon.",4
5,"Brand New, Works excellently",17-Jan-18,Yes,"This blender comes straight from the manufacturer and is brand new, with the 8 year warranty. The price was quite low (under 200) so I bought this one to get my foot in the Blendtec door (they are the best blenders on the market). I will buy a larger wildside jar later, but I am perfectly pleased with this little beauty. It blends like you hope it will.",1
5,Thank you Treasure Truck!,28-Nov-18,Yes,We often once already but Bought this for our daughter and son-in-law on an awesome price from the Amazon Truck. We love BlendTec (vs. Vitamix) because it's pre-set buttons take the guess work and remembering out and our favorite thing is it has NO SHARP BLADES! Our kids make their own smoothies and milk shakes and can clean it themselves without us worrying about them cutting themselves.,2
5,Love it. Now I can throw out that horrible ...,10-Dec-16,Yes,Love it. Now I can throw out that horrible Cuisinart glass blender food processor duo that doesn't actually blend anything and is too small to actually chop anything. This is not too loud and it blends smoothies into a wonder smooth consistency. I'm not clear on what each type of jar does but I'll keep using this until I find I need the wildside jar.,3
4,Good Machine,15-Feb-12,Yes,"I received my Blendtec blender about two weeks ago after deliberating for quite awhile about whether to buy a Blendtec or VitaMix and whether I could justify spending $400 on a small kitchen appliance.  However, green smoothies have become a daily fixture in my life and I was fed up with the bits of fruit and veg left after the standard (albeit high quality) blender had cast its lackluster magic.  The Blendtec produces a smooth, creamy smoothie, but a single go on the 'smoothie' cycle is not sufficient to obtain such results.  I have to pulse the mixture an additional 20-30 seconds to yield the desired outcome.  I haven't yet tried the blender with anything other than green smoothies, so I can't comment on any of its other capabilities.  I can say, however, that the lid is a bit fiddly and the base dances around the countertop when blending unless you hold it in place.",5
5,powerful blender,21-Jun-12,Yes,"I have had this blender for about 6 weeks now and have used it almost every day, mostly to make green smoothies.  It has a powerful vortex that pulls the food down into the blade and pulverizes it into liquid form and does not require a tamper tool.  It is super easy to clean without taking apart a bunch of components, which helps to keep your hand away from that sharp blade.  I have also used it to crush fruit for making jam, but I believe I have only scratched the surface on all of it's abilities.  It comes with the standed ""Four Side"" jar, but if you plan on making larger recipes you may need to invest in the ""Wild Side"" jar that can handle larger volumes...It comes with a nice recipe book that includes easy-to-read instructions and helpful color photos, along with a good index, ingredient definitions, and pre-blending prep suggestions.  The powerful 3 HP motor is somewhat intimidating at first, and is it very noisy!  I have seen commercial versions inside a plexiglass cover to dampen the loud noise, but there is not much you can do about it at home.  Make sure the top is on securely or you could end up with a serious mess on your walls.  I guess this is the price to pay for such power - I think I could use it to mow my lawn!!",2
5,Don?€?t be tricked into thinking older brand names are best,24-Jun-18,Yes,Most wonderful blender I have ever owned after years of using the loudest blender which I believed to be the best Blendtec is a true blessing makes the best smoothies with much less sound does everything you need ThankYou treasure truck,2
5,larger version and if you blend on an uneven surface or you blend with a lot of frozen food stops the blender from bouncing and moving like other blenders,21-Dec-17,Yes,"If you are serious about your blending, this blender is worth its price. This is the heavier, larger version and if you blend on an uneven surface or you blend with a lot of frozen food stops the blender from bouncing and moving like other blenders...This is a blender for those who can't boil water. The blender uses SmartBlend technology that senses and id's potential problems. I don't know how it does it but it blends a little bit differently when I blend up Chia seeds or a smoothie so that the bits are truly to a minimum and superfine for the Chia. This blender is the absolute best for blending/grinding seeds and nuts to a superfine powder. Works great for nuts and seeds to turn it into different types of flowers. This blender, for me, makes the best smoothies. I use 4 cups of kale, a lemon, cup of blueberries, 5 large strawberries and it is the consistency is super smooth and not chunky. I put it in a thermos and with a simple stir later on in the day, the smoothie goes back to being smooth and chunk free...We also own a Blendtec blender that is close to 8 years old and still works great. We use it at least twice a day. We did have to have it repaired and replaced and it was super easy and the replacement unit was shipped quickly. The customer service and warranty is also top notch...If you blend everyday and use a blender with your everyday cooking, this is a perfect blender for you.",4
5,This thing is amazing!,20-Jan-14,Yes,"I've worn out a lot of blenders in my time and then a friend recommended this one. Wow. It's truly amazing. We use it for everything from grinding rice flour and pulverizing nuts to turning whole fruits and vegetables into juice, smoothies and even making soft serve ice cream..It's super-easy to clean and unlike the Ninja (our last blender) there aren't a million nooks and crannies for food to get lodged in. Also unlike the Ninja there aren't multiple razor sharp blades to nick you when you clean it..As well as this is constructed I think it's going to be a long time before I wear this one out. Well worth the investment.",3
5,A good blender,1-Jul-15,Yes,Glad I got this blender. Love it. Made about 20+ smoothies in it. The first few I used the smoothie button found they seemed bubbly. Not a fan of that. Thought maybe was using to much water. Started using the ice cream button and having much better luck. I enjoy a thicker smoothie. One that needs a spoon. I love the fact that it has the different buttons. Takes the guess work out of knowing how long to blend things. It is so loud though that I have to cover my ears. Also have all my windows closed so I don't feel like I will disturb my neighbors. :),1
4,Good and bad,24-Jun-12,Yes,"Good:.This is a very good blender blending away all the fruits and veggies into a really smooth smoothie. It has been a god-send to me as far as my kids' eating of veggies/fruits is concerned. My son (and to some extent my daughter as well) is very picky eater, so much so that he refuses to eat any veggie/fruit. This blender blends everything to such a creamy texture that my kids gobble the smoothie up - i make sure that all the veggies (spinach, carrots, avocado etc) get drowned by sweeter/tangier fruits (all berries, bananas etc)...bad:.1) For the price, it really is picky about the order in which you throw in the stuff in the blender - it has to be water, solids and ice, in that order. Forget that and this blender is worse than a 50 dollar blender from walmart. (checkout some biased videos on youtube that exploit this behavior of blendtec)...2) If you put stuff into the blender that takes more than 50-75% of the volume inside the jar (regular one, not wild-side), then all of its 1000+watts is of no use, the top most later just stays as it is, while the bottom portion is blended a little bit - sometimes it just doesnt move ahead in the 'smoothie' mode at all in this state. Only way out of this is to remove half of the contents and blend in two separate batches - yes it is a pain for me. If I am paying 400 bucks for a blender, I would expect it to blend at 75% full.'..Anyway, overall, when works, works like a charm..[Let me add that i have used this blender since April beginning and made more than 50 smoothies]",3
1,Looks like it came straight off somebody's counter,16-Jan-17,Yes,"Purchased new blender, got a filthy used blender. Looks like it came straight off somebody's counter, thrown in a box and shipped.",43
5,This Thing is the S$%^&amp;,11-Jan-14,Yes,"I love this blender. It literally pulverizes the food. It beats the seeds to nothing. Its literally like you're juicing the food. Only used the smoothie and soup functions so far. Haven't had the courage to use for ice cream yet, but I will. I was so against spending tons of money for a blender, but it does do a much better job and blending. The lid is great, easy to clean, if you clean right after usage. The blades do not come out, the blades are not sharp, they are blunted, which makes me scratch my head. I'm not afraid of reaching down in it to clean. If you're considering a Ninja, don't. Spend the extra money and get the good stuff. You won't be mad at all. Those ninja blades are dangerous to handle.",2
2,It has started to have what sounds like a bearing problem with it rendering it unusable in ...,26-Apr-18,Yes,I bought this blender about 5 years ago. It has about 466 cycles on it. It has started to have what sounds like a bearing problem with it rendering it unusable in its current condition.  I was surprised to have a problem with this unit that I paid around $400 for.  I did have a jar failure around a year ago and Blendtec to their credit did replace it. I did submit another claim for the motor problem and will have to wait to see how that go's.. If the problem is solved in a reasonable way I will correct my review. I do truly hope they fix it because we really like this blender.,0
5,This Blender is Amazing,1-Nov-13,Yes,"I'm forced to be on a modified liquid diet due to a medical condition, so smoothies are a mainstay for me. I had one of those personal-sized blenders before that couldn't even manage to blend ice. After staying with a friend and watching her use a Blendtec, I knew I needed one...It's pricey but if you need to use a blender as often as I do, it is well worth it. I make a daily smoothie that includes whole fresh fruit (cut in half), frozen fruit, fresh kale (main vein removed), fresh carrots, seeds, yogurt, and almond milk and this blender transforms the ingredients into the smoothest smoothie I've ever had in just 40 seconds. Clean up is very easy - you just add a cup of hot water a little dish soap to the jar and pulse it briefly. Easy. The base is pretty heavy but the jar is a lightweight plastic. I am disabled and have very little upper body strength, but I can clean it without much effort. I love this blender and will never go back.",13
5,Worth every penny.,1-Jun-16,Yes,"I purchased this five years ago, and it's still going strong. It blends perfectly every time. In order for it to blend well, you have to pay attention to the order you put things in. It makes a difference! View the recipes by Blentec as a guide. I am just now going to replace the jar, after five years because it has become cloudy. I probably caused that from grinding coffee or leaving liquid in it too long. However, I've used it almost daily for almost five years and I'd say that I have gotten my money's worth...Love it!",8
1,Shredding plastic,22-May-18,Yes,I?€?ve had it 6 months and it?€?s shredding plastic into my smoothies :/,8
5,Best Blender I've Owned,16-Mar-12,Yes,"I love this blender.  I wanted to grind grain, but a decent grain mill is almost as much as this multipurpose blender so I sprung for the blender...With all the complaints of it being loud I expected it to sound like an airplane was landing in my kitchen when I used it.  It is NOT that loud.  It's a blender, and it sounds like it is blending.  It is louder when you are blending ice and grain and other hard things; just like every other blender in existence...For anyone who is wondering, yes it does a wonderful job on grain.  I've been attempting to not eat an entire loaf of fresh made wheat bread made from freshly ground wheat (which kicks store bought wheat flour in the teeth!) all day...I'm happy with my purchase which is saying something because it was really hard to spend that much money on a blender.  It took me about a week to work up the nerve to actually BUY it it, ha ha!",9
5,blend 'er done,20-Mar-13,Yes,"There are two possible approaches for a blendtec review. one is to compare it to virtually all other blenders. The other is to compare it with one very particular blender...As far as all others:.The high speed blender category is a paradigm shift. This isn't a toy to make frozen drinks once a year. This is an investment in your health and a real tool in the kitchen. It delivers consistent results, every time.Buy this to make your green drinks, etc...As far as the one rival:.That is a good product too. The basic difference is that the blendtec is shorter and does not have the 'tamper'. I give the slight edge to this product.",2
4,"50 Cycles Use So Far, My Blendtec TB-621-20 Total Blender Performs Very Well.",14-Dec-12,Yes,"For the update of my review about more than 5 years ago, I would like to add a few things about my Blendtec Total Blender:..My blender currently registered a 1,828 cycles of usage. During this period of time I encountered two experiences of jar leakage from the black rubber seals at bottom of the jar. Fortunately the jar is also covered with the 8 years warranty, so I could request a free replacement. The first jar leakage was happened at around cycle 900 and the whole process of requesting the customer services was not a good experience. But eventually I received my replacement jar free of charge. Last year in November, I experienced another jar leakage at the same point and I called Blendtec toll free number to request a new jar.  This time I found out the quality of customer service was excellent because the waiting time to get a representative's response had been much shorter, in addition, they told me there would be a new improvement of the seal in the new jar which contains double bearings and.new TEFLON seals. Upon receiving the new jar, I do find that not only it is a better made jar, but it actually reduces vibration and noisy during blending. Job well done Blendtec!..I suggest that all Blendtec Blender owners should request a new jars from Blendtec once you experience a leakage from the jar before your warranty is expired...I blend smoothie with tomato, apple, carrot and potato every morning. I used to use a Oster Model 6891 Blender to do the job. In order to get really smooth smoothie from the Oster, I had to blend my ingredients for almost 10 minutes, sometimes longer, because quite often there would be cavitation formed, so I had to stop, got rid of air pocket and started again. After received recommendations from friends and some internet researches, I decided to take the plunge to buy a Blendtec Blender which is 10 times more expensive than the Oster...After 50 cycle use of my Blendtec blender, I found out: 1. It's quieter than Oster in operation; 2. It's much faster to get the job done(60 seconds vs. 10 minutes plus of Oster) and does the job even better(much smoother smoothie than before); 3. It's very easy to get all the stuff from the jar and very easy to clean afterward...Will it blend? My Blendtec blender really blends even tomato and apple seeds in just 60 seconds. The reason why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found out in my smoothie, occasionally there would be one or two pieces of small(about 1 or 2 rice grain size) solid carrot, no other solid ingredients but carrot. Go figure...By the way, Blendtec Blender now comes with a seven years warranty which even covers the jar. This is really awesome. I highly recommend this product to everyone who concerns of his or her healthy diet.",3
5,An appliance worth having,17-Nov-18,Yes,"I have been using this blender on an almost daily basis for the past nine months and it has given excellent performance. It has been a dream making smoothies and soups (the pur??ed kind) and I am very happy that I bought it (it took me months of going back and forth, doing research, because of the cost, and I finally just went ahead and did it.) It is loud, but aren?€?t they all? I use noise canceling headsets with loud appliances anyway, so that isn?€?t a real problem. Well worth the investment.",0
3,It is a nice blender but it doesn't chop as well as I ...,16-Mar-18,Yes,"It is a nice blender but it doesn't chop as well as I would have expected.  Like many others if you do not have enough liquid, it will not go anywhere. I like my NInja better.",1
1,Did even start. Took it out of the box ...,21-Aug-18,Yes,Did even start.  Took it out of the box and plugged it in and powered it on and the display kept saying ?€?error ......?€?,2
3,Could Be Better,1-Feb-17,Yes,The blender did not come with clear instructions. The power of the blender makes it necessary to hold it down so it doesn't bounce across the counter. I am only moderately pleased with this product.,3
5,My favorite kitchen appliance.,26-Oct-14,Yes,"Awesome -- we've had one for 2 years and the highest compliment that I can provide is that I just bought another for a gift for my sister.  We make everything from smoothies, almond milk, banana 'ice cream' to a cashew cheese substitute in it...Haven't found anything,that's otherwise edible, that it can't blend...It's loud -- but, that said -- you can't expect it to blend everything and still be whisper quiet.  It's a little louder than my coffee grinder -- but, given that it's only run for bursts, I'll take that all day long.",1
5,Can't get enough of this blender!!!,15-Apr-12,Yes,"Absolutely pleased with this product! I was debating at first whether to buy vitamix or blendtec but then after reading and comparing reviews decided to settle on blendtec which was $100 less but got equally good reviews. My mom and I blend fruits every morning. I would alternate apple and carrots with some oatmeal and honey and some days I would do berries. My daughter whose a picky eater loves blended apple, carrot and kiwi. It just pulverizes it and makes it into a wonderful juice drink that she can tolerate ingesting versus having to eat all three fruits all day. Now she consumes it in no time and then some all througout the day. I feel happy that we're all getting our required 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables daily without having to feel like you're eating every minute every second all day. I would highly recommend this to anyone who would like to start eating healthy. Great buy!!!",8
5,Blends stuff like a banshee!,11-Jun-18,Yes,holy! this thing blends anything! I am surprised just how great this super blends anything I throw at it! I use it for green smoothies and no way you would get the smooth fully blended final result with another blender! plus a great warranty!,0
5,blendtec total blender - wonderful,23-Nov-10,Yes,"This is a life-changing addition to my kitchen. When I read labels at the store and see all the unidentifiable ingredients I realize what a difference this is making in my family's lives. Because it's so easy I've been baking whole wheat bread every week and love the muffins, too. I make green smoothies and soups, all with whole fruits and vegetables and no chemicals. I intend to try more recipes over time -- jelly, applesauce, dips and sauces. Many recipes just require adding all the ingredients at once. With others you add some and process, then add the rest. With the push of the button it processes while I do other chores and cleanup is easy, too - just process water and a drop of detergent and all the remainders are swished away (but I do fully wash it later). The unit itself is easy to wipe clean because it's digital. No dials to get gunked up.",3
5,Best blender ever,22-Oct-18,Yes,I use this blender every day for my smoothies. I can't eat regular food and on moat days I'm on a liquid diet and I can make a smoothie or soup in just a few minutes. Clean up is a breeze! I just add some warm water and a few drops of dish soap and then buzz it again for another 20 seconds. Easily the best purchase I have made and even told my doctor about it for other patients that have my rare stomach disorder. I would recommend this blender to anybody!,0
5,This is it!,30-Dec-17,Yes,"I have tried a lot of Blenders from Oster, to Ninja, to Vitamix....nothing compares to the power and simplicity of Blendtec. I'm in love.  I use mine  everyday with out fail.",1
5,I love this thing,22-Feb-18,Yes,Will it blend? Heck yes it will! I love this thing. It blends exceptionally well and is super easy to clean because the blades are blunt. It's super loud though! You may want to hold the base if you're blending a lot of solid objects because it shakes a lot...BUT BOY DOES IT BLEND!!!!,0
5,99 and I am so happy customer!,3-Dec-17,Yes,You can't beat this..I paid $189.99 and I am so happy customer!!..I have owned ninja vitamix and nutriblender..and this blentec is almost same performer as vitamix,1
5,We have been using this daily and love it! We are making healthy smoothies and delicious ...,4-Jun-18,Yes,We have been using this daily and love it! We are making healthy smoothies and delicious soups. I bought one for my father in law who now has to have his food puree due to his illness. He has since gained back some weight and is a lot healthier. He has been a lot happier because he can still have a tasty meal and get the nutrients that he needs. I highly recommend this for those that have aging parents with ailments that hinder their ability to eat solid foods.,0
2,Like running a leaf blower at full power inside your house,13-Jul-12,Yes,"My smoothie counter is nearing 150 smoothies now and the product has become as loud as a leaf blower at full power.  My kids run to the farthest room possible whenever I am about to operate this and I have had to resort to wearing earplugs whenever I make a smoothie.  This can't be right!  It does make great smoothies if you don't mind a few chunks of frozen berries or mango that he blender missed.  I make a green smoothie everyday with this blender and it has served me well for over a year now, but the noise that comes out of this machine is almost unbearable now.  I am really looking at getting the new vitamix, which claims to be 40% quieter than their other vitamix models.",5
1,I choked on black rubber particles in my smoothie,2-Dec-15,No,"<div class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"" id=""video-block-R2HL038MWDL9LN""></div><input class=""video-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1gtmswuBFS.mp4""/><input class=""video-slate-img-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bXSymvMGS.png""/>??I've had my blendtec blender for 2 or 3 years now.  I used it daily for the first 6 months and then probably 3-4 times a week since then.  I have 2 blending canisters and one of them started chewing up the rubber or plastic that holds the blades in place. The smell is awful, like the motor was buring up, but when I took a drink of my smoothie, I choked on small black pieces of plastic/rubber material. I strained it and took pics of the pieces and made a short video to share.  I called Blendtec (800-253-6383) and they are aware of this problem. They are sending me a replacement canister to get me by until they fix the problem and update their canisters so that this does not happen in the future.  The customer service tech ""Eric"" said that he didn't know when the next generation ""corrected"" canisters will be available, but that they will be sending an email to their registered users and replace the bad canister with the ""corrected"" canisters to those of us who have had issues with the old canisters.",46
5,It is so powerful that even the toughest kale leaves can become super smooth after blending,8-Apr-18,Yes,"This is quite an upgrade from my previous 20 dollar supermarket blender. It is so powerful that even the toughest kale leaves can become super smooth after blending. I use it pretty much every day for green smoothies, which has a pre-programmed setting for 1 minute. Another pre-programmed setting I use for is the Hot Soup, which I use to make soy milk from soaked and cooked soybeans. It also keeps counting how many times I have used it and so far it's close to 100 times since I purchased it on Black Friday 2017. According to my family members who have been using this brand for more than a decade, this machine is going to last for more than 10 years. I'm looking forward to countless healthy smoothies that I will make out of this machine. Considering how expensive those healthy smoothies cost in a store, and all the healthy benefits it will bring in the next ten years, I consider this purchase a steal.",3
5,I love how the smoothie option makes my drink so creamy,12-Jul-18,Yes,Well worth the money. I love how the smoothie option makes my drink so creamy. It blends my spinach so well. No leafy particles that i can still taste.,2
5,This was the best thing I've ever given myself,17-May-18,Yes,This was the best thing I've ever given myself. I'm cheap and this blender looked so expensive. But I took a chance and it paid off. I use this thing 4 to 5 times a week to make green smoothies for lunch at work. I've increased my intake of greens and broccoli 10 fold with this blender. It's excellent and I've had it for a good while.,0
5,Transformed the way I eat!,1-Nov-18,Yes,I love smoothies. Always have. Now I eat them every day. Living the dream. I accidentally broke mine and the Blendtec customer support sent me a new one free! Truly a wise investment.,0
5,I actually enjoy making smoothies with this blender!,14-Jun-15,Yes,Looks killer! So easy to clean! And super powerful! I'm lovin it. It will whip anything in to a smooth drinkable liquid. The blades spin so fast it will actually heat liquids if run long enough. I've been missing out on eating healthier because it was much a hassle. I should have made the investment years ago.,3
5,Reliable and Powerful,2-Jan-13,Yes,"I've used this for about a year now.  It has worked flawlessly -- 680 cycles so far.  I use this blender mostly for making fruit and vegetable juice from whole foods.  It took me a little while to get the hang of cutting things up a little so that everything would blend on it's own.  For example, anything round needs to be cut in half.  Also, when making juice, the liquid will get warm, so I always throw in two ice cubes, or use a little frozen fruit, to keep the mix cool.",4
4,"Lovely, But Not Actually Idiot-Proof",1-Oct-10,Yes,"As vegetarians and aspiring vegans who are not exactly the culinary-wizard types, my roommate and I have relied on a juicer for many light meals- a labor-intensive yet nearly idiot-proof practice. We decided to purchase the Blendtec after seeing a live demo at Costco, during which the representative used handfuls of whole fruit/vegetable to make juice. We quickly surmised the Blendtec was invariably simpler, clearly superior to our juicer! Owning one would be life-altering, probably! Now the proud owners of the Blendtec, we have failed miserably to create a juice that resembles something other than swamp water and are dually unable to achieve a consistency smoother than chowder. Even when following the recipes provided by Blendtec, we still manage to create separated, pulpy sludge. Undaunted by our setbacks, we persevere with optimism and undying affection for this piece of equipment. It *is* immeasurably easier use, clean, and store than our juicer, and we have had great success using it in capacities for which we did not specifically purchase it, e.g. making rice flour and grinding flax. In sum, it requires more skill to operate than is immediately obvious, but this quality is offset by varied utility, durability and easy maintenance.",15
5,Blendtec 3hp Food Healing,28-Oct-11,Yes,"I love my Blentec!  Thank you for making it possible Amazon so I could afford it.  I didn't really think that it would make a big difference changing from my regular household blender to the Total Blender from Blendtec.  I am pleasantly surprised how much creamier my smoothers are.  Also, I can put ANYTHING in my blender!  On a food-healing regiment, there are parts of fruits and vegetables that would normally be thrown out, but that is where all the nutrients live!  Also, it blends so well that my ""not so favorite vegetables"" can be put in there and I cannot even tell.  This super blender completely micronizing my food so that it is readily available for my body to absorb it's nutrition.  Having previously had a problem digesting my foods, it would take me 3 years to chew what takes seconds with my blender!  Finally, the part that this blender has in Jeff Primack's food-healing system has helped resolve a rare auto-immune disease (that had ""no cure"" by Western medicine standards) and many other health issues too-numerous to count in this review!!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you! So, if you haven't discerned by now, I hightly recommend this blender!  It does not seem as loud as what I have read in previous reviews, but I know everyone is different.  This was worth the money!  What I am saving on medical bills is far more than the cost of this blender!",7
2,A tremendous waste of $400.,2-Jun-16,Yes,"We bought this after much deliberation, and upon having it two days are incredibly disappointed with this purchase and are returning it to Amazon. Following every instruction verbatim from the user manual, websites, everything - it just doesn't perform well. Our smoothies are more like cold juices, there's no substance. The carafe can't handle any kind of reasonable quantity to make a smoothie for two people. Tried making the ice cream recipe from their recipe book following it exactly 100% three times and it never made ice cream, just a big wet smoothie...Additionally, the machine is too light for it's power and was literally jumping around the countertop - I had to hold it down to keep it from bouncing away. We had an old KitchenAid blender that was starting to die, but even at a fraction of the cost of this Blendtec it outperformed it by a long shot...Tremendously disappointed in Blendtec. Returning immediately and going with our second choice, a Ninja.",4
5,A Real Workhorse,5-Mar-15,Yes,"This blender is fantastic!  I provide food for a cancer patient who can no longer eat solid foods, only liquids.  I make a 'frosty' for her three times a day, using all frozen ingredients (she wants it like ice cream, so it's more like food), and it handles them beautifully. I don't use the pre-set buttons, because it has to start on high immediately; I just move the speed up to 9 right away.  It only takes 30 to 60 seconds to blend.",5
5,it blended my smoothie quite well and easily. Time will tell how I feel about it,17-May-18,Yes,"Amazon wants me to review this blender, but truth is that I have not used it enough to properly asses the Blendtec. On the handful of times that I have used it, it blended my smoothie quite well and easily. Time will tell how I feel about it. I've come from a large family that only uses Vitamix, but when I saw the price I had to pull the trigger and try it out, as I was curious about its capabilities against a Vitamix. So here's to the future. FOR SCIENCE!!",0
4,Great Blender with only one small limitation,18-Dec-12,Yes,This blender is great and gets your food broken up into much smaller pieces than any of the cheap blenders. I will say the one thing it fails to do is blend the super tough stem of a kale plant. It has gotten stuck a few times for me and I've had to take the stem out and hand break it down first. In part it's the fibrous nature of the plant stem and the fact that it's hard as a rock! Never had a problem with anything else though.,4
5,Happy we bought a Blendtec,25-Jun-18,Yes,"I use it every morning for smoothies, and we use it often for cooking. I've had it for about six months now and had zero issues with it. Happy we bought a Blendtec!",0
5,Totally voracious appetite for anything edible!,23-Jan-14,Yes,"Turns any edible big thing into many tiny tiny bits of edible awesomeness!.When it comes to grinding vegetables ""The Secret"" is adding a half to one whole banana! The banana is a stupendous tip. If you are new to grinding veggies......start with spinach...Don't juice (ew), get ALL the fiber and goodness with this fantastic grinder blender.  Look at the videos on YouTube under the moniker: Will it blend? These are funny, fantastic examples of this product's powerful capability...Spend a little extra and buy this product! It is a great investment in your better health.",3
5,Makes a great smoothie!,6-Aug-18,Yes,"Do you buy smoothies or frappes with any regularity? The mark up on these beauties is insane. Cut out the middle-man! This blender pays for itself in a few months, and allows you to make it just the way you like it!",0
5,Happy with Blendtec Blender,23-Oct-13,Yes,"I haven't used it extensively at this time, certainly not to the extent of it's capabilities and have only had it for a month.  I had upper and lower jaw surgery so am not eating as I would normally so haven't tried it to all of the ways I hope to use it in the future.  My daughter has had one for some time and makes fruit and vegetable smoothies all the time and loves hers.  I have blended chili and different soups with meat and vegetables in them and they come out perfectly smooth and easy to eat for someone that can't chew harder food yet. I have also made wonderful smoothies and the recipe book has lots of great ideas.  I would recommend it but as I said I haven't had it very long or tested it to it's full capabilities, however my daughter has had hers for some time and recommended it to me.",4
5,Couldn't be better unless it was free.,4-May-17,Yes,I've had this for 6 months and couldn't be happier..This thing blends.  Smooth smoothies with no seeds or chunks..I love being able to push one button and walk away and get perfect results..Fits on the counter underneath the cabinets..Never needed to tamp or stir the ingredients.,1
4,The Blendtec Saga,10-Jun-14,Yes,"To start my review....the Blendtec came in very good timing after placing order.  However, when I opened the package, the blender was ""dirty"".  As if it had been used, put back in the box and mailed to me.  The lid had ""green stuff"" around the top, the handle was dirty and looked like ""food particles"" were stuck in it.  I immediately called the Blendtec company and reported this.  The young man with whom I talked with was very apologetic and said that a new Blender (which is what I ordered and paid for) would be shipped out immediately to me.  I did receive the ""NEW"" blender within 7 days, opened the package and yes, it was a NEW blender!  I returned the ""USED"" blender to them.  I am very happy so far with this Blender.  It seems to be all that it has been advertised to be. I am enjoying experimenting with it.",2
5,vesatile blender,17-Sep-18,Yes,"A great buy for my kitchen to replace an old one. Very satisfied. Veggie, fruits, ... more choices for healthy food",0
5,We love our unit,14-May-16,Yes,We love our unit! When the motor didn't work it was replaced right away. Hassle free and now I have an extended warranty for 8 years.,3
5,We love this blender,15-Mar-18,Yes,"We love this blender. We use it all the time to make smoothies, milkshakes and protein shakes. Blends everything we throw in there with ease. Very easy to clean up as well.",0
5,Great Machine at a great price,12-Apr-18,Yes,Great Machine at a great price!  We now have two.  The first is still going strong.  Just need one in our cabin.  Now we can have great smoothies on both ends!,0
1,Inferior product,29-Sep-18,Yes,The first blender I received wouldn't even run at all and this was a brand new one so I sent it back and got a replacement (also brand new) and it would barely run. It was very slow and didn't blend everything.  The panel was not easy to understand without reading the manual and the manual was a generic for all Blendtec blenders not your specific one.  I honestly can't support spending this kind of money for an inferior product.,0
4,Great but - Will the plastic last?,7-Jul-13,Yes,"Great blender - chops, purees, minces, shreds almost anything. Ice for Margeritas? No problem, toss the cubes in. The motor is very strong and it appears well built .The only reason I don't give it a 5 Star rating is because I don't know if the plastic  container will last. We have had so many kitchen  gadgets of great design whose plastic parts have inevitably cracked/failed that my assessment has to be guarded.",2
3,The blender is ok. Doesn't blend strawberries seeds as ...,7-Nov-16,Yes,The blender is ok. Doesn't blend strawberries seeds as expected and requires mixing to blend anything. I expected to throw fruit in blender and to get a smooth drink with no work. That is not the case,1
4,Four Stars,7-Apr-18,Yes,Love the blender. However the jar started leaking after one week of use.,1
5,the best,1-Feb-17,Yes,Best blender ever! Makes the smoothest creamiest hummus you can ever ask for,2
4,and it works great. I would say it is very comparable to ...,20-Jun-18,Yes,"This is my first quality blender, and it works great.  I would say it is very comparable to the vitamix that my friend has, at least with the smoothies and food processing I've done with it.  The one touch buttons are great too.  I am a little concerned as after the 8th use, a portion of the lcd panel went out. It's not worth returning, and Blendtec did say they would replace it, but I don't want to go without a blender while I wait for the replacement.",0
5,No dancing,11-Jun-18,Yes,Work like a charm for smoothies that include frozen fruit and veggies. It doesn't dance on the counter when blending.,0
2,Seal leaks and smells bad.,3-Aug-18,Yes,"While it does do the thing it was supposed to do: blend things, it smells bad doing it. the seal at the base of the jar leaks and now smells like used underwear after.",1
4,"Loud, but extremely powerful and versatile",28-Nov-16,Yes,"I've owned this blender for more than five years now and I still love it. After all this time I can still just throw a bunch of frozen fruit and soymilk into it and let it do its thing. As long as you have enough liquid in with the fruit, it will make an awesome smoothie. After all this time, I think the blades are starting to dull because once in a while I will find a sizeable chunk of fruit left in the smoothie, but another quick run through the blend cycle and that's taken care of...I've made hummus and peanut butter in it a few times, and there was a lot of scraping and re-blending involved, but no more than you would expect with any blender. I've never tried to make fresh juice in it, because isn't making fresh juice in a blender just making a smoothie? I don't get that setting...It totally pulverizes ice cubes and makes the best frozen margaritas. There are no chunks of ice left at all...But maybe the best thing about the Blendtec is the customer service. A few months ago, the blender base started to short out and turn itself off (not great, I know, which is why I deducted a star). I mistakenly thought the base had a lifetime warranty so I contacted customer service. They had me send in the base and sent me a new one which arrived in days. I just looked it up, and the base has a three-year warranty - so they actually sent me a new base well after the warranty had run out...The only other slight criticism I have is that the blender is very loud. But the motor is really powerful, so you have to expect that. You can either have a wimpy blender that doesn't make much noise, or you can have a workhorse that rips right through whatever you throw into it. I'll be using my Blendtec for many years...I paid full price for this, by the way, and I don't regret it even when I see it on sale for much less. With the number of smoothies I make, I would have gone through at least two other blenders in this time because my cheaper previous blenders kept dying.",2
4,Four Stars,2-Jan-18,Yes,Not the perfect blender but stronger than your typical blender,1
5,Long time use analysis of my Blentec Home,22-Aug-11,Yes,"First off, the reason i even considered this MUCH MONEY for a blender in the first place was because I like smoothies.  I mean, I really like smoothies.  I drink them once a day.  When I first started getting into it, I used my parent's $80 blender.  Then that broke in a month, and I got another $70 blender. Which broke in another month.. and then I got ANOTHER $70 blender... all meanwhile, the frozen ingredients of my smoothie would always get trapped, and not sucked into the blades.  I always had to blend portions at a time or shake the jar a few times in order for it to blend.  I keep seeing how they do it in Jamba Juice and I wondered.....Then I decided to spring for the Blendtec. I mean, if this thing can blend an iphone, then this thing can blend my smoothie......that was 2008..-Since, this blender has been used 765 times (it comes with a built in counter)..-It takes frozen strawberries and smooths it out, or it takes a cup of ice and turns it into SNOW, not crushed ice, but smooth silky snow..-the jar is BPA free.-A bigger jar is available.-it fits under the counter.-for fresh juice and salsa, i dont have to cut the ingredients as much because the blade design is wide it ""sucks"" everything in...-ive been drinking a lot of Acai + Blueberry smoothies as a result :)..SERVICE:..One day my blender wouldn't turn on July 2011, i called blendtec, shipped it back over to them.  And in two weeks, the blender was serviced and shipped back to me all under warranty.  No, they didn't give me a new blender, they actually FIXED it. Unlike so many companies nowadays that figures its cheaper to send a new one than to fix the old one, which really says something about their products.  Also, fixing appliances create less waste, etc...Anyways, I like this blender.  If you blend something once a month, get a cheapy.  If you're going to blend everyday, this is a great investment!",7
5,Five Stars,19-Jul-17,Yes,"This blender is awesome! If you use one every day, this one makes the smoothest smoothies!",1
5,So worth the price tag!,4-Dec-13,Yes,"Seriously, this thing is worth the almost $400 price tag. I was a little skeptically at first and had trouble seeing myself spend this much on a small kitchen appliance. I'm so glad I did because it makes the best smoothies. I didn't even have to add that much water and all of my greens were perfectly blended. I've owned several cheaper blenders, including the baby bullet, which I used for my son's purees. It's nothing compared to this. I definitely recommend it, especially if you like making smoothies with lots of leafy greens.",2
5,Like it better than my Vitamix,10-Aug-15,Yes,I recently purchased this for my vacation home. We have a vitamix at home and I was using a older KitchenAid blender in the vacation home. It was driving me crazy. I looked up both the blendtec and vitamix on Amazon. Turns out the price for the blendtec new was the same price as the vitamix refurbished. Plus the blendtec had the shorter container so I knew it would fit in the small kitchen of my vacation home. I have to say I like this way better than my vitamix. I'm thinking about giving my vitamix to my daughter so I can buy a blendtec for my home as well. The buttons on the front that allow you to punch smoothie or whole juice or soup are freaking awesome. I didn't know I needed them until I used this machine.,5
5,Powerful,10-Oct-18,Yes,Good so far. Made green smoothie and I have made ice cream both did very well. Love it so far.,0
3,Rather disappointed with this purchase,19-Dec-17,Yes,"Rather disappointed with this purchase, purchased a new unit but the jug came with food residue which makes me think that it was either used or returned.With it being the holidays and it already arrived late, I just washed it and it works fine so far. We'll see as time goes though.",1
4,Love it but just wish it had a bit more ...,9-Jun-18,Yes,Love it but just wish it had a bit more instruction for items not on the specific display buttons. The display buttons for things like smoothies are amazing. The speed is regulated and runs cycles in addition to turning off when it's done so you don't have to do a thing. Cuts through ice like a dream too!,0
5,"Powerful, easy to clean.",5-Jul-18,Yes,"This thing is great. Blends everything, easy to clean. Yes, it makes soup!",0
5,mostly for creating juices with the fiber so as not to waste anything. This one is a gift for our ...,4-Dec-14,Yes,"We have had 2 of the Blendtec blenders. Very powerful, sometimes too powerful. You have to pay attention to using it. It can grind flaxseed into butter and burn it. But we use it everyday for something, mostly for creating juices with the fiber so as not to waste anything.  This one is a gift for our daughter.",2
5,Five Stars,22-May-18,Yes,This Blender is excellent. very powerful . I've made pesto sauce. I've made smoothies for the kids.,0
2,Not worth it.,27-Apr-18,Yes,"Noisy, feels cheap with the light plastic base. Didn't blend as well as my standard Kitchenaid. Cavitation is a major issue. No tamper included. I will be returning this and saving up for the Vitamix.",0
5,I filled my Blendtec up about halfway with ice cubes ...,5-Aug-15,Yes,"I filled my Blendtec up about halfway with ice cubes and just a bit of water and let it run for about 30 seconds.  What it creates is indistinguishable from real snow, which, when used in place of ice in a beer bucket, makes an impressive display on a hot summer day.",3
1,Broken,21-Aug-18,Yes,Blended for two seconds and then shut down.  Returned to Amazon,2
5,So far I thought it work well and my mom is satisfied with it,7-Jan-18,Yes,"I have the other brand blender, I brought it for my mom, but comparing with mine which is very expensive.So far I thought it work well and my mom is satisfied with it.",0
5,"Blendtec TB-621-20 Total Blender, Black",4-Jan-13,Yes,I did a lot of research on this item and could not decide between this and the Vitamix.  The Blendtec is loud and moves around a lot but it's lower in height than the vitamix and far more advanced with a digital display. the other great part is that this blender can break up seeds and avacado pits due to the 3hp where as a vitamix cannot due to its 2 hp.  The seller delivered this pretty quick!,1
5,Exceptional quality and excellent customer service,14-May-18,Yes,"Blender stopped working on the 3rd use. Blentec immediately sent a shipping label and replaced it at no cost to me. Had a new one in a week. 8 year warranty, made in the USA. Exceptional quality and excellent customer service.",0
5,Very powerful and versatile blender,17-Jan-18,Yes,"Love this blender! I don't use it very much, but my fiance uses it for a variety of things (sauces, smoothies, steel cut oatmeal pancake mix, etc.) and is very happy with it's performance.",0
5,I have had this thing for at about 4 years ...,28-Jan-15,Yes,"I have had this thing for at about 4 years. It is built to last, no mechanical problems. If you use too much ice at once to make a smoothie, then sometimes it does not blend because the shaved ice shrapnel sticks to the sides too much. I solve this, I use the liquids and HALF the ice, then blend, then add the second half of the ice.",3
5,Simply Amazed.,25-Aug-11,Yes,"Bottom line: This appliance is amazing and I don't think I could ever live without it now that I have one.  I'm generally frugal with my money, so at first I balked at the idea of a blender that costs several hundred dollars; however, this product is in a league of it's own which is why I refer to it as an appliance and not just a blender.  You see, I had several blenders gathering dust in the depths of my ""miscellaneous"" cabinet.  My Blendtec sits on my countertop as the star of my kitchen and gets used 1-4 times per day, more than any other appliance I own.  I enjoy expensive professional quality smoothies, frozen coffee drinks, fresh soups and dressings that cost $5+ at stores, which is why I decided to take the leap and invest in a Blendtec, figuring I would save money eventually. My counter is already at 101 in less than a month, so I have more than earned my money back on this purchase by making my own products, plus I know exactly what is in them and can experiment with flavors. I highly recommend this to anyone in need of a serious blender.  I have not had any issues with it at all, it functions beautifully, no leaks, and very easy to wash (blend warm water &amp; soap on pulse for a few seconds.)..The recipe book that it comes with provides some great starter recipes in every category that can be easily adjusted to your taste.  I also purchased some xanthan gum to use in my smoothies and soups which is what the pros use to give blended products that perfect thick &amp; creamy texture.",2
5,You will not find a better blender for home use,12-Apr-18,Yes,You will not find a better blender for home use. We purchased two. One for ourselves and one as a gift. An excellent product. Very well built.,0
3,It?€?s a great blender but for some reason it develops a weird ...,1-Jun-18,Yes,"It?€?s a great blender but for some reason it develops a weird ?€?sour?€? smell if you don?€?t use it for a while. The smell goes away with a soapy rinse, but kinda ruins your appetite for a smoothie.",0
5,High quality,6-Sep-18,Yes,We use this blender for our daily morning shakes. This is the most high quality blender I have ever owned and I absolutely love it.,0
1,BEWARE of this blender!,9-Dec-15,Yes,"BEWARE of this blender!.As others have warned you, it does not simply work poorly or fail to work after some use, you may find yourself ingesting plastic/rubber goo: the liquified seal inside the blender jar.  I had read other reviews AFTER I had purchased my Bendtec, that described the breakdown of the seal after so many uses.  Mine started to breakdown after only 272 uses!.While washing the jar, I saw black marks on my dishtowel and my hands.  And sure enough, I discovered what others have reported: the black washer/seal on the bottom of the jar was liquifying!  This is a lot of money for only 272 uses!  Find another blender.  I'm looking now, myself.  Good Luck!",24
5,Works well,12-Jul-17,Yes,"First off, I bought this from the Treasure Truck. If you have a Treasure Truck in your area, I highly recommend trying it. It was easy, fast, and fun!..Ok, now to the blender. I bought this to replace my aging Vitamix. So far I have used it to make a lot of smoothies, some soup, adult beverages, and nut based sauces. I have not used it for anything really tough yet. So far I really like it..  The features that I like are it's button set up, the counter, it's ease of use, and it's size while sitting on the counter.  To begin with,  I find it really nice to be able to push a button  (smoothie for example) and then do other things and not have to watch it every moment and try to figure out when it's done. I also like that it counts every use. You not only can feel confident that it was new, you also can calculate how often you are really using it. I am actually leaving mine on my counter, where I feel like it fits better than my Vitamix did..  There are two things that I don't like quite as much. First, if you forget to put something in your smoothie, the feeding hole in the top is really hard to access. By the time I pry that piece out if the middle of the lid the smoothie cycle is done. (There goes my count :).  The other thing that I am not so fond of is that the container that it came with holds a smaller volume. While it is nice to have it smaller for the counter, it's not as nice when your usual recipes are coming out of the top because you forgot to make them smaller..  All in all, I really like it. My Vitamix was old, whiney, and was starting to smell like motor when I used it. This one has a 7 year warranty, and I am hoping that it will last long beyond that.",1
5,Fantastic blender,22-Sep-18,Yes,This is an amazingly (3 hp) blender. Love it! I recommend purchasing it.,0
5,Thanks for the other reviews,25-Jul-09,Yes,"Thanks so much for the reviews on the Blendtec---especially to ""Crankypants"" who wrote the review ""Vegetarian's Best Friend"" a couple of years ago.  I saw it in early July of this year ('09) and it convinced me to invest in the Blendtec.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I also ordered several of the books he recommended and have totally changed my diet with the blender. I'm recommending it to all of my family and my friends as a powerful health tool.",4
5,WELL WORTH THE MONEY,5-Sep-16,Yes,So glad bit the bullet and spent the $$ for this - it is great.  Used it for our annual margarita party last week and it made drink-making a breeze.  HUGE improvement over my old kitchen blender.,0
4,Powerful but LOUD,25-Oct-18,Yes,title says it all,0
5,I use this nearly every day,26-Feb-13,Yes,"To get full use out of this excellent blender, you should have one of the larger jars, and the small, round-sided jar. The small jar comes with a lid with prongs which help keep the contents moving when blending things like nuts. I purchased the small round-sided jar after the large one did not perform well making nut butters. Soon after I bought it, Blendtec sent me a free liquid- proof lid for it, because the pronged lid is not liquid proof. This is an appliance which has seriously changed my cooking habits and expanded my abilities. Do you like to use dried chiles in your sauces and chilis? Most other blenders leave big chunks of skin, even after thorough re-hydration. If you're ok with a little texture, you would not even have to strain the chile paste this blender produces. (I do, for velvety smoothness, but it's not really necessary.) It handles frozen fruit and ice cubes, reducing them to a nice granita texture. I'm not a fan of the ""whole fiber"" juice this produces, so I strain it, too, especially for citrus which would really be better pressed. Also, egg whites do not beat to foam in this blender for some reason, probably it is too fast and furious and breaks the proteins? Since you're considering plunking down $400+ for this, I've listed all the cons, but I  do NOT want my money back on this blender; it is one of the best appliances I've ever bought.",2
5,Smooth Smoothies,25-Dec-14,Yes,"We love this blender!  It's our 2nd since starting to make healthy smoothies.  It's super easy to clean (we just rinse with hot water after blending).  The smoothies come out very smooth, no chunks here!  We've yet to try the other options like whole juice because we really love making smoothies.",0
5,Smoothie Every Morning,31-May-18,Yes,I love my Blendtec.  A smoothie every morning for breakfast!,0
4,Four Stars,22-Dec-17,Yes,"This works as intended, but did not look a new one when I got it. Very disappointing.",2
5,It's so nice to have a blender that actually blends without me ...,1-Apr-15,Yes,It's so nice to have a blender that actually blends without me havin g to shake it around and a tick spoons in the blades to clear it out. What a concept! Worth every penny.,2
5,Impressed !!,8-Nov-07,Yes,"This is a very fine product. I purchased this blender in hopes to get more vegetables in my diet. I am a weight lifter so I wanted a better alternative than taking vitamin and mineral supplements in pill form. I feel that the whole food is better than pills and using a juicer. I was considering getting a breville juicer but realized I did not want to make a mess. I know if I start making a mess I probably won't continue. I read alot that most of the nutrients are in the pulp left over from juicing including fiber. So I went with the best Blender on the market. All fingers pointed to the blendtec. When I got the blender at first look I was not impressed. It looked bland and a little cheap looking. Although I'm not sure what I expected the blender to look like. My first blend was cucumber, strawberries, avacado and a little soy milk with water. Pressed smoothie button and blast. This thing is powerfull. The smoothie was great. I have been very impressed with this product and hope it holds up for a very long time. Lets be honest the price tag is ridiculous. The most expensive appliance you could own. I highly recomend this If you have the bucks.",21
5,Five Stars,11-Sep-18,Yes,I am a Blendtec fan from even before I bought this unit. Lifetime partner,0
5,DELICIOUS SMOOTHIES,12-Sep-13,Yes,"As a blender, it is great.  I've only made smoothies and ice cream but both turn out perfectly.  I am quite happy with the blender and ease of use.  It is easy to clean and I don't have to worry about cutting myself on sharp blades in the bottom of the jar when I dry it.  It can be quite noisy, but I just leave the room.  Too, when I reach underneath the blender to pull it forward on the counter, it has some rather sharp edges underneath...I've had the blender only a short time and look forward to experimenting with all the pre-programmed blend cycles.  The included recipe book was a nice addition too.",3
5,Be sure you put your liquid in first for best results!,13-Mar-18,Yes,This is our 2nd Blendtec for our vacation home. We are active home chefs and love this blender!,0
5,This is perfect..,1-Mar-18,Yes,"I read many many reviews for the Blendtec vs Vitamix and didn't want to spend a fortune on a blender but still wanted the quality. This is perfect... I do smoothies, almond milk, juice and soups. It does all of those perfectly. It sits on my counter and we use it almost daily. Highly highly recommended.",0
1,"this was suppose to be reconditioned, but we used ...",17-Mar-18,Yes,"this was suppose to be reconditioned, but we used it for one and  one half month's before the motor got so hot it started to smoking, thin tripped power strip..I think they never did anything to this unit.my wife was chopping almonds that were soaked the night before that killed it?",0
5,Powerful,30-May-18,Yes,Wow! This blender is powerful. High end blender.,0
5,Five Stars,28-Jul-18,Yes,a power house.,0
4,Wonderful product,9-Oct-10,Yes,"I love this blender!  I have been using it pretty much every day &amp; my only problem with it is the Noise!  It is darn loud.  My husband keeps telling me I'd better not turn it on before 8am or the neighbors will be complaining.  I do have to plug my ears when it starts to wind up.  But.... aside from that, I did take one person's advice &amp; did not attempt to turn it on until I read the instructions.  Found that this was a good idea.  I've made smoothies, cocktails, green shakes, salad dressing, soup.  I keep browsing the nice recipe book that came with it for more ideas.  I haven't actually heated soup in it yet because I usually make a very large batch, but I do use it to puree items for the soups.  I am concerned that the little plastic insert in the lid with the prongs that fit into the lid might easily break.  I'm very careful with it.",5
5,Best Blender I have ever had,26-Jan-17,Yes,Best Blender I have ever had.  Does real quick work on smoothies and protein shakes.  Got a great deal on Black Friday which made me take the plunge and I'm glad I did - kicked my Ninja to the curb,2
5,5-star,30-Jul-18,Yes,Best purchase ever,0
2,Wish I had a vitamix,24-May-14,Yes,"So, I ponied up and bought what is supposed to be the best blender out there.  In the beginning it struggled even with just a fruit smoothie.  We've since come to an agreement about that ( no ice), but smoothies aren't the only reason I bought it.  Its supposed to be powerful, a whiz, nothing stops it...except chick peas.  I just spent 20-25 minutes attempting to grind chick peas and other ingredients into hummus.  Air pockets happened every 5-10 seconds, even pulsing doesn't help.  There is also a horrible clunk that sounds like the rotating gear has just stripped itself.  There are still plenty of chunks in the hummus and I'm going to start shopping the Vitamix brand.  I'd been using a very old one for my fruit smoothies when I bought this.  I have never been satisfied with it...want to mix juice with water?  great, buy a blendtec.  Want to make hummus or grind ice?  get a vitamix.  for the money, I hate it.",4
2,Vita mix a better choice,31-Aug-18,Yes,Very loud and not that great with smoothies,1
5,Five Stars,19-Feb-18,Yes,Wider and more powerful than a Vitamix,0
5,Awesome Blender,17-Jul-12,Yes,"After I purchased this product, but before I received it, I thought to myself what a fool I was.  Why spend all this money for a blender?..In short, because this blender works exceedingly well.  Everything about it is great.  Very easy to use.  Very easy to clean up.  And so powerful that it does the job perfectly and quickly...Smoothies are terrific and the juicer works exceptionally well.  What I do now is use the blender to make my lunch which is a combination of a smoothie/juicer.  I put in some fruit, throw in more spinach and carrots, add peanut butter and fill it to the top with water.  I set the blender for juicer and I get my lunch.  It comes out purely liquid with no trace of the elements that went into the drink!",2
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,11-Sep-18,Yes,"its keep saying OVERLOAD! Called Blendtec, they said its the defect oneand did not apologize for it. They sounded like its obvious that its defect. DO NOT BUY!!",1
5,love it,17-Oct-13,Yes,My very favorite appliance at the moment use nearly every day &amp; blends everything so well.I highly recommend this blender..Unfortunately or fortunately I had it plugged into a circuit breaker adapter which failed continually and I realized that this blender from the US was not adapted to NZ power without a transformer. These were so expensive that I have not used it now for some time &amp; can't sell in NZ. If anyone wants to buy it off me &amp; take it home to the US let me know. Used for only a couple of months.,3
5,Five Stars,18-Feb-18,Yes,"A great machine, extremely powerful. Makes great smoothies!",0

5,"The ""Gladiator"" of home blenders",11-Apr-16,Yes,"This is the best blender ever.  In particular I like the blend settings programmed for sauces, smoothies, and other applications. It out performs the Bosch I formerly owned.",0
5,Is that a jet taking off?,24-Apr-14,Yes,"I love this blender I use it everyday to make frozen fruit smoothies which it does amazingly.  The only down side I can see with this blender is that it is very noisy but its a blender they are.  This thing can chop anything nuts, beans, ice and so much more.  I am just now starting to use it to make my own flour for my Ezekiel bread works great, just have to use small portions.  All in all I would recommend this to anyone, I absolutely love it.",0
5,best blender I've ever used!,19-Jun-12,Yes,"I specifically bought this blender for it's ability to juice whole fruits and veggies.  I have to say it's on the pricier side but well worth the price due to it's performance and overall versatility.  Ever since receiving it I've used it every single day, primarily for it's ""whole juicing"" capabilities.  It's different from those large juicer machines that extract only juice and no pulp.  I prefer the pulp I know everything I put into it will come out like a thicker juice but I love it.  It is very user friendly, powerful, easy to clean, and worth the investment.  I plan on owning this for many years to come and it has greatly helped to improve my overall health lifestyle.",1
4,Four Stars,25-Jan-18,Yes,Very useful but very very loud!,0

5,Five Stars,19-Mar-18,Yes,THIS IS IT~~~,0
5,So far so great,31-Jul-11,Yes,"I purchased this blendtec about 4 weeks ago.  I've made fruit smoothies, juices and salsas with it, so far.  Based on other reviews, I thought this blender was going to be extremely loud, but I didn't find it any louder than my regular 'ole blender.  I like that it has buttons for what you are making.  I simply press the Whole Juice button to blend all of the fruit and yogurt I've added to the canister.  It mixes it superbly.  I'm still trying to perfect my salsas.  You have to be careful not to over Pulse it so that it remains chunky, rather than pureed.  I was also pleased that it came with a rather extensive recipe book.  My next venture is to make hummus!",5
3,Bought it because of the great reviews,30-Oct-13,Yes,"High priced. Worked as described for ~month.  Used regularly as instructed.  Somehow, someway, the motor started sounding more ""metallic"".  Very loud.  I'd liken it to a worn transmission. Something's amiss. Didn't bother sending it back because it still works but with the incredibly annoying high pitched squeal.",1
5,Five Stars,25-Apr-18,Yes,Absolutely in LOVE with our Blendtec!  Not sure how we survived without one!,0
5,Easy to use and clean,9-Jul-18,Yes,"So far we?€?ve only used it to make smoothies. It?€?s been great. It?€?s really fast, easy to use and easy to clean. I used to cut myself trying to wash the old style blender that wouldn?€?t always work right.",0
1,Too bad I waited 2 months to open and use it,16-Jun-18,Yes,"I'm getting a overload error at first use.  Too bad I waited 2 months to open and use it, now I have to go through warranty.",1
4,Five Stars,8-Sep-15,Yes,"Smoothies daily. Works very well after the first month of use...Update: After about 900 times using it for smoothies, what seems like the rubber insulation piece at the bottom of the jar broke apart suddenly. Motor is still fine but the jar needs to be replaced now.",0
5,Powerful,23-Jun-16,Yes,Heavy duty blender. Came with an 8 year warranty. I have never spent this much money on a blender in my life but now that I have used it I am not disappointed.,0
5,I love my Blendtec,28-Sep-10,Yes,"We purchased our blendtec after much, much deliberation (in spring of 2010).  I really wanted to make my own flour for more nutritionally dense baked goods and to make our own baby food. Plus, we didn't have a blender anyway.  I'd read a lot about it and once we got over the sticker shock, we bought it.  It doesn't grind the flour as fine as I like (ie. for pastries) but it works great for all purpose flour.  I have noticed that the pulse button is really helpful when things get stuck in the corners.  Only once have I gotten the Overload screen and I was obviously asking too much of it (I'd already run it a few times on a setting that was too high and hadn't discovered the usefullness of pulse). It's really easy to use and I really like it.",2
5,Must have Blender!!,1-Dec-18,Yes,"This is perfect, My friend got this year ago, it doesn't have blades, it works on speed which I love because it never cuts my finger. it is 100 dollar cheaper . perfect deal. very satisfied!!",0
5,"Excellent blender, and can pretty much demolish anything",13-Jan-17,Yes,"Excellent blender, and can pretty much demolish anything. Easy to clean. My only complaint would be the noise, so if you use it in a small place like my apartment is, arrange some setup (stuffing rugs underneath bedroom doors) to not disturb sleeping roommates, and loved ones.",1
4,fantastic product ... if you read the directions!,17-Jan-13,Yes,"I've owned my Blend-Tec for a year now, so I think I'll take the time to write a proper review...A lot of people on here hate on the blender saying it won't blend certain things, but that's because you didn't read the recipe book! When mine came in, I immediately opened it up and tried to make a green smoothie and was disappointed. I thought it just wasn't that good of a blender. Then I read the book and learned the order you're supposed to put things in and every smoothie, even ones made with frozen fruit, turns out fantastically. This same trend follows for everything...I love this product, but I honestly think the VitaMix would be just as good. I'm not upset that I chose the Blend-Tec, nor am I self-righteously happy that I didn't get the VitaMix...The good:.-green smoothies are great.-you can make home-made flour.-I've never broken it, and I do eat frozen food and make date sauces..-you can say ""Will it blend?"" before each smoothie you make.-easy to clean..The bad:.-you have to read the cookbook, which isn't really a bad thing. It was actually very informative..-the container does get scratched if you make flour out of dried beans or something like that, but it still works just as well..It's a great product to own. I use it every day and I've never regretted my purchase.",1
5,Wonderful Kitchen Item to Encourage Healthy Eating,26-Dec-16,Yes,We have loved using our Blendtec every single day since getting it. We use it for frozen fruit shakes and also with our Shakeology. We originally bought one from Costco and had problems with is so we took it back. This one we got through Amazon has had no problems at all and we are very satisfied with our purchase. The benefit of a high quality blender is making it easier to get the nutrition you would otherwise not get. We like to blend spinach daily with our shakes so we are forced to eat vegetables without complaining.,3
5,Don't get suckered by Ninja!,7-Jan-17,Yes,After suffering through my Ninja for longer than i should have i am happy to have stepped up to a class act of a blender.  Just starting to scratch the surface on what my blendtec can do but I have zero regrets at this point (which I could not say about my Ninja),0
5,It's amazing!,3-Jul-13,Yes,"I'm increasing my intake of fruits and veggies daily to a point where my body is wondering what happened! The BlendTek is worth the money just as a smoothie machine. Sure it's loud. You don't sticking raw carrots,frozen mango and. Frozen blueberries and kale and Expect it to hum. I highly recommend it.",0

5,"All other blenders are inferior!  The Blendtec is one of those, ""Greatest ____ Ever"" things.",27-Dec-12,Yes,"I am 26 years old, and finally have a decent job where I can say...""Let's buy some nice stuff for your lovely wife and yourself.""..I first got turned on to the Blendtec Total Blender by Joe Rogan's podcast...""You mean the guy from Fear Factor?!"" Yes I mean that Joe Rogan who is shockingly one of the coolest guys ever.  Then I watched some amazing videos by Blendtec [...]where they blend anything you can think of (iPhones, rakes, old spice, Justin Bieber (you'll see), and tons of other things) into dust!..We have been on a smoothie kick and had a barely functioning blender that was kind of getting the job done.  We dreamed at night of juicing, having smoothies with perfect consistency, blending soup, and we woke up and I said I am ordering this for Christmas and I don't care about the money...You look at the price tag and are kind of shocked, but what you are buying is something that you will have forEVER and if it breaks in the first SEVEN years it is under warranty.  Stop buying cheap pieces of junk and treat yo' self...Poets should be writing about this piece of beautiful machinery.",2
5,Absolutely amazing!,24-Dec-14,Yes,"This is an incredible blender! Not sure what else I can say. Yes, it's pretty loud. No, that does not stop us from using it at least once daily on average",1
5,Built like a tank. LOVE IT,21-Jan-12,Yes,"I've had mine for 4 years and it still works flawless. I did replace my jar once. Not bad consider the hell I put mine through. I use mine several times a day, it will blend anything. I love all the small things that make it enjoyable. For example the bottom is rounded so when it's upside down, water from washing, drains to the corners, where holes let the water escape. Brilliant. The square jar enhances  the mixing effect. A round jar makes things go round and round, the square jar causes interruptions in the flow which causes things to get sucked into the blades more effectively. The buttons are a touch sensitive plastic membrane. EASY CLEANUP! Just spray and wipe. No stupid plastic buttons to try and clean around. What can I say, I recommend this to all my friends. Best blender. ever.",2
5,"Strong blender, finally",26-May-12,Yes,"I'm a cook at home and have gone through all sorts of blenders, including the Kitchen Aid Commercial one.  I bought this Blendtec blender after reading reviews with hopes of getting the blender that lasts more than a year or 2 before burning out the motor.  I'm one month into it and do indeed find it incredibly strong, sturdy and easy to clean (no unscrewing the bottom and taking it all apart just to clean it).  People comment on its loud volume.  Well, sure, it's loud, but it's a motor blending.  It's not on for hours at a time, but less than a minute.  It works, it's strong, it's easy to clean.  I highly recommend it.",1

5,Amazing blender,31-Aug-11,Yes,This blender does everything as advertised.  I use it mainly for fruit smoothies.  It crushes ice nicely.  When using frozen fruit I have found it helpful to thaw the fruit a little first.  I have even added fresh spinach..My whole family loves having smoothies and we are eating more fruits and vegetables and this blender is helpful in that..I really don't have anything negative to say about the blender at this point.  It cleans easily (a cup of water and drop of soap and run it through a cycle.  It's sturdy and it fits on my counter under the cupboard.  I'm a very content purchaser.,1

4,It is powerful and easily purees spinach,26-Oct-16,Yes,"We use this nearly everyday, multiple times per day, for smoothies, soups, and more. It is powerful and easily purees spinach, broccoli, kale, and carrots. If the price was more reasonable, I would have rated this a 5/5.",0

4,Blendtec blenders are awesome,11-Feb-14,Yes,"This blender make short work of most everything. Just don't put in large pieces of fruit as it will get caught in the vortex above the blades. Make sure you cut up your apples and carrots to lengths not bigger than 2"".",0
5,Love My Blendtec,13-May-13,Yes,I know that Vitamix is giving Blendtec a run for it's money but I'm in Blendtec's corner all the way...No complaints.  Dishwasher safe.  Does everything and more...And will fit under the cabinet!,1

5,Perfect for weight watchers!,18-Jul-11,Yes,"I waited a few weeks before entering this review to get a better perpective, and this blender does not disappoint!  It is solid, simple, and does exactly what it claims to do...Cleaning could not be easier (use hot water to rinse out because of the sugars in fruits and my favorite sweetener, agave.)  Every few uses put a couple drops of dish soap in with a bit of hot water and run the blender for a few seconds.  This blender fits under my cabinets even when in use.  The programs are good, but I find myself using the manual speeds just as much...*Weight Watchers* -- If you are in Weight Watchers, or are considering it, this is a great tool.  I use this every day on the program, and sometimes twice a day.  On the Points Plus program, fruit and veggies are not counted against you, so just toss in whatever you have, fresh or frozen, then some spinach, then some of your favorite fiber powder or protein powder, sweeten with splenda or my choice of agave, and finally add crushed ice on top.  This gives you a large smoothie with between 0-4 points depending on how you sweeten it...Make sure to read the instructions, as this will give you great hints such as placing the liquids on the bottom, fruit/veggies in the middle, and ice chips on top...This blender goes through anything!  Peel, core, seeds, ice, whatever.  Don't bother doing too much prep, one of the excuses I used to have was that eating healthy foods took too much time.  Just toss it in and turn it on then rinse it out.  Hint:  Buy larger, stronger straws.  Sucking down a delicious whole foods smoothie is more fun with a proper straw.  I use a Starbucks reusable cold cup with it's own straw...This (and any other high power unit) is quite loud.  But most cycles last less that 40 seconds, and some are done in much less than that...To make great (and much cheaper) Frappacino drinks, buy some xanthum gum which prevents separation.  Use Starbucks Via (iced variety), add cocoa powder and sweeten as desired.  Add ice chips, skim milk, and xanthum gum.  For weight watchers, the Via contains a bit of sugar, so beware of adding too much additional sweet stuff...Other stuff you can make include:  healthy dips, soups, salsa, hummus and so much more...Yes, this blender is expensive, but it is of such higher quality that it is well worth it.  Also, the money you spend on this is nothing compared to the expense of health related expenses of being like me: overweight, out of shape, and not eating fruits/veggies...I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoy mine...UPDATE 21 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE:..Still going strong after 21 months! The counter reads 601 smoothies/sauces/soups and much more. This should give you an idea of how much we use ours... nearly every day. We have 'sneaked in' tons of veggie of all colors and types and our kids love it! Then we tell them there was spinach or kale in it and they shrug, and say 'well, I guess we like kale now.' As long as it's blended in this awesome blender anyway...",7
5,Great but noisy,21-Jan-13,Yes,"This blender came highly recommended by a few people and with good reason. It does it's job really well. The different blending cycles really let you control how your 'creation' turns out and so far turns out a quality result every time...My only gripe with it, and it's a minor one, is the noise. It really gets loud at the higher speeds and since we live in a small town home, we have to keep in mind what time of day we use it. :)..That notwithstanding, it's a quality product and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic blender.",0

2,"Thanks for ruining any chance I had at a happy life, Blendtec.",23-Apr-18,Yes,"I bought this on a whim because the treasure truck had it deeply discounted, one day only. I thought to myself, ""This blender will change your life! You'll eat fresh fruit smoothies every morning for breakfast, blended whole veggies for dinner every evening, you'll lose 60 pounds, fall in love, have kids, and live happily ever after. Hurry up and buy it!"" So although I had no inclination when I woke up that morning to buy a deluxe blender from my phone while I'm supposed to be working, I did it for the sake of my dreams and by 7:00pm I had it in my hands, along with the free twister jar that made it an even better bargain...Well, my dreams are not coming true and I am in fact going to die fat, alone, and angry at the world because this blender just does not live up to the hype - not even a little. I want it written on my tombstone that Blendtec is to blame for the tremendous misery and suffering I endured during my short time on this earth...The problem with this blender is that only works if you add at full two cups of liquid to whatever you're blending, AND whatever you're blending is pre-chopped into tiny chunks. So, for my fruit smoothies with 8 oz. of almond milk and a few dollops of coconut yogurt, I can add frozen fruit that's already factory cut into small pieces, a little ice, and it blends fine. But to be honest, that is not a particularly tough job for any blender...Where this thing turns into a complete anger-inducing piece of garbage is trying to blend fresh veggies. Leafy greens, like spinach or kale, just sit there in the jar, laughing at you while the blade spins loudly underneath without circulating a thing. Go ahead and stop the cycle, tamp it a little and circulate things yourself. You think that's going to make a difference? Ha! In your dreams. The ONLY way to get a handful of spinach, and handful of kale, chopped up carrot, celery, and cucumber to circulate to the point that the ingredients start blending is to add ** 2 entire cups of water ** to the jar. Because that's exactly what you want, right? To water down the already weak flavor of your cucumber and celery and kale smoothie? Were you hoping to get all your ingredients to fit into a 30 oz. tumbler so you could choke it down as quickly as possible? Sorry!! You're gonna have to dilute that to 46 oz. and prolong the intense suffering endured by your tastebuds. And again, if you're going to do this prep work and add that much water, any blender in the world can do this job...My blender currently says it's made 34 beverages, but I've only made 11 smoothies. Because it takes two to three cycles to get a blended veggie juice, which also ends up getting heated to luke warm temperature which makes it even less appealing. The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because technically, with enough liquid and patience, it will eventually product a blended drink. But, for the amount of money this thing costs, and the claims made by all the other reviewers, this thing should be whispering sweet nothings into my ears while it blends my wildest dreams into reality. Instead, the neighbor's kids are crying because the man next door is shouting profanities in his kitchen again. If their dad comes over to complain again, I will be referring him to Blendtec because it's all their fault!",6
5,This is the BEST blender I've ever owned,6-Apr-15,Yes,This is the BEST blender I've ever owned! So powerful. Easy to use. Not sure why there is a counter on the digital face that shows how many times it's been used - that's strange! But other than that it's a great appliance! Would buy again.,0
5,"Great blender for smoothies, applesauce",30-Jan-12,Yes,"This blender is great for home use.  I can easily make a smooth blended drink from frozen berries, bananas, and other ingredients.  Great consistency.  Loud, but not any louder than you'd expect -- put some rubber underneath it to cushion the noise.  Great for making applesauce!",0
5,Five Stars,15-May-17,Yes,I use it multiple times a day for everything from smoothies to hummus to making rice flour.,0
5,Expensive but worth it.,31-Dec-14,Yes,"This thing is freaking amazing! Used every day. Nothing that goes in is wasted. Everything comes out very smooth. Very, very easy to clean. Expensive but worth it.",0
5,Good and easy to clean,10-Jun-09,Yes,I love this machine! Powerful and versatile. And the best of all is how easy it is to clean it--just rinse it under the faucet. Since I use it daily I don't think I need to use soap. The big question now is how long can this wonderful thing last. I hope the metal parts are durable.,4
4,Prepare for blastoff - you're in the mix,15-Oct-14,Yes,It does the job.  I think it's better than a Vitamix because of the programmed settings so it turns off by itself and you can walk away from the noise.  Why is this not five stars?  Exactly that...the noise.  This thing sounds like a jet taking off.  I think they could improve the acoustics.,0
4,makes everything--except maybe ice cream,18-Dec-12,Yes,"I bought this so I could make my own ice cream for my daughter, who is allergic to 14 food families.  It doesn't.

5,100% love it!,29-Jun-13,Yes,"I had been researching juicers for a while, and stumbled on the blendtec. After reading about it, I was ready to purchase. It has exceeded my expectations. We mainly use it to juice, but the other options are amazing. My favorite part is the fact that it juices/blends all the seeds I put in. It even breaks down chia seeds! You get what you pay for and it's worth every penny! The cleaning is extremely easy as well! Love, love, love.",2

It's all plastic and too lite.  It jumps around like a rabid animal.  I mean, it does a great job and I wish I could give it 5 stars but I can't.  Too much plastic and what the heck.....the lid has little holes around the lid handle. For ventilation I guess, but your mixture spatters out of those holes every time. So annoying and freakin' messy. Like cooking isn't messy enough.  Good but not perfection.",2

5,A++,13-Dec-14,Yes,"tl;dr: Extremely happy with my purchase; Strongly recommend it to you...Item arrived on the designated day indicated when I purchased it. Out of the box it was in great shape, no defects or visible problems. Followed the instructions on how to clean it before first use, which was an easy process...Then Margaritas. Lots and lots of Margaritas. Emptied most of a freezer's worth of ice into the gaping maw of this Blendtec beast, and it's stainless steel teeth obliterated it into smooth whipped frozen goodness. Occasionally we'd throw it a curve-ball and make a Daiquiri. From what we can remember, our new Blendtec significantly contributed to our happiness that evening...The next day the Blendtec was put to task making extremely smooth protein shakes. We also got bored after eating a watermelon and discovered that the Blendtec could puree watermelon rind. This prompted a spirited game of Will It Blend...Blendec - 17.Misc Items - 0..Used it almost every day since. Made a killer pesto in it last night...The only negative about this Blendtec blender is the afterburner-level decibels of noise it produces as it's decimating your food items. The overwhelming awesomeness of this blender makes up for it, and as such this item receives a solid 5 stars.",3

5,"Works great, with one aside",4-Dec-12,Yes,"This works GREAT. We crushed ice into snow cone worthy ice shavings in under a minute...I usually use this for green smoothies, so this is my one aside - be sure to put your greens, veggies, and fruits into the blender in the right oder (look in the recipe book for ideas about this) otherwise you will be pushing greens down into the blender from the hole in the top and getting frustrated. Also, make sure you have enough liquid. Yes, this thing blends it all, but you still have to use it right to get the best results.",3

5,Worth every penny!,27-Dec-09,Yes,Gotta love it.  It blends everything into a very smooth consistency.  It is easy to clean - no assembly or disassembly.

I just crushed some cacoa seeds in a smoothie and they are definitely not crushed up into microscopic little pieces as I had been informed a Blendtec would. I can feel nibs and bits and pieces.

Ours is so scratched up you can barely see through it. Still, I think this is one of the best green smoothie makers on the market. I'd still get this over other ones on the market.",2

After researching a couple, this Blentec seemed to be a good choice. However, after using this -- I find this blender to be a disappointment; it doesn't blend half the time (&amp; yes I put enough juice in my smoothies). It's very frustrating, it's like the blade isn't doing anything!",3
5,... had a Blendtec for about 12 yrs and I love it! Bought it from Costco,10-May-18,Yes,"I have had a Blendtec for about 12 yrs and I love it! Bought it from Costco. I haven't had any problems with it. I did however have a problem with the jar leaking so I called Blendtec and even though it was out of warranty she sent me a new one! That's great customer service!  I read where someone said the top popped off. I don't think she had it on right mine has never popped off. She also said there was only a vent hole, the jars now have a bigger hole on top that you can easily add more ingredients through or a tamper if needed. Sometimes if I add too much ice I will need to add more liquid and then push the ice down and blend again. That is the only time I need a tamper.  You can blend anything with this blender! I read that someone could still feel the texture of the seeds in a fruit she used, if this happens just blend longer and everything will be smooth. I love being able to have a smoothie in just a matter of minutes! I use spinach and kale and it all blends smoothly no pieces of leafy veg left. Just cut bigger fruit into a couple of pieces and throw it all in. My grandkids love my smoothies so it's nice that I can make one for them in just about 2 or 3 min so they can have one before school and they don't mind at all that there is spinach in it! You can add spinach to the ice cream too! I also love that I can grind wheat or any grain no need for a wheat grinder, and it will grind sugar to make powdered sugar in just a minute if I find that I am out and need some. I have a jar for dry blending and a jar for liquid blending since blending dry does scratch the inside of the jar. It is also very easy to clean. If you do happen to forget to wash it out right away just let it soak with hot water for a bit and it will clean easily. There are just so many things you can do with this blender. I just bought a new one just because the treasure truck had it at an amazing price and it is the newer model so why not! You cannot go wrong with this blender! I highly recommend it!",0
2,Heavy duty users - beware,8-Aug-12,Yes,"I bought this power horse of blender from Amazon in Aug 2010 to replace the same model of Blendtec blender purchased on Ebay maybe about 1 1/2 years before, which I forgot the register.  The motor burned up.  Blendtec had guaranteed me that the first blender's failure was a fluke.  The motor of my 2nd blender burned up in 2011.  I quickly received a newer model blender from Blendtec to replace the bad one under Blendtec's 3-year warrantee.  It is now August of 2012 and this unit's motor is also burning up.  The motor's RPM's are fluctuating and the electrical burn smell is strong...Blendtec now says I have to ship the current model's motor base back for repair.  And the company offered to put a rush on it.  However, it still can take weeks...This is what I call heavy duty use - I blend fresh cut up produce with water added on an average of 2 to 3 times a day using the whole juice option, a pre-programmed option that takes 45 seconds - the longest time and the fastest RPM's during the last part of the cycle.  Works great by the way.  Love what this blender can do when it's working.  The amount I blend ranges averages from 6 - 20 oz...My current view is, these motor failures are no fluke.  If you are a heavy duty user like me, look elsewhere.  The relatively cheap price when compared to Vitamix is not worth the failures, which is what earned the 2 stars from me.  If you are an occasional user, it should last you a lot longer then mine have for me and you will probably love it.  The pre-programmed options make blending sooooo easy, and once you learn how to stack the produce in the canister, you just press a button and voila.  No more hands on is needed, except to pour. The recipe book is great and cleanup is a snap.  You decide :)  I'm going with a Vitamix next.  We'll see what happens lol...Edit:  Oh yeah, forgot.  As other reviewers said, the Blendtec blender is extremely noisy.  I think one reviewer was not far off when commenting that its decibels compared to that of a leaf blower.  I knew this before buying it.  I use the mickeymouse over-the-ears ear muff hearing protection when using it, and when others are close by or in the kitchen, I move the blender to another room and closed the door before blending.  Just don't have enough ear protection for everybody :).",3
1,I am very disappointed with the quality of the jar blades,20-Apr-17,Yes,I am very disappointed with the quality of the jar blades.  I bought 2 jars for my blendtec and within 2 years the blades came apart and won't turn.  I bought a blendtec for my mother and the exact thing happened to her jar.  I went to order a replacement jar and they are over $100 and they won't sell the blades separately.  Highly disappointed.,4
5,It just works!,21-Jan-10,Yes,Bought this for my girlfriend who's recently gone 100 % vegan. Looked at a lot of positive reviews before buying but was still surprised by just how good this blender really is. Everything we make in it comes out nice and smooth without any hassle...It's a little noisy but who cares... It's only on for 30 secs at a time...Highly recommendable!,3
5,Great Blendtec,27-May-15,Yes,"I would recommend for anyone, who loves healthy blending.",0
4,"Good blender, but overpriced",25-Mar-13,Yes,"I like the blender, it does a good job, but for $400 and what you get I think its overpriced.  The unit does a good job blending my smoothies.  It isn't perfect though.  Somethings it has a hard time with, I occasionally still get a few chunks remaining, but rarely.  Like it can't really blend dates, and sometimes a frozen blueberry or two is left unprocessed at the bottom of the jar.  But in general its a really good blender. I don't really have any significant complaints there.  I just think it's overpriced. It's basically a motor.  The quality of the unit is average.  It has a plastic jar.  The unit vibrates a fair amount on my counter. Sometimes it vibrates so much it moves a few inches along the counter. The buttons are 'plasticy'.  Its a good blender I just think the price should be about half what it is. For $400 I would expect more weight so it doesn't vibrate so much, and higher quality.",1
5,Powerfull and reliable,4-Apr-13,Yes,Purchased this product to primarily make smoothies.  The power with which this product operates at is very impressive.  It has handled everything I've been able to throw at it.  I hope to rely on this blender for years to come.  Worth every penny.,2
5,I love my blender! &lt;3,4-Oct-12,Yes,"I purchased 3 of them in total. I got the first one for my parents to make healthy veggie-fruit-nut juice. Soon, my sister and I got our own blendtec, exactly the same one! It's very easy and fast to make juice in the mornings, afternoons, and at nights. We are not only using it to make juice. I also use it to make creamy pumpkin soup! Yum! Oh, and soy milk!!..I have owned this product for over a year now. So far, I'm still loving it!.The only complant I have is they make loud noise when it's blending...I would recommend this blendtec to everyone!!!",37
5,Very nice blender,19-Feb-12,Yes,Got the blender for 3 days and already made several smoothies with it. Very happy with the blender so far!,0
5,Better smoothie maker than my Vitamix,3-Feb-17,Yes,I have only use this for smoothies.  I owned a Vitamix for 20 years it finally died and I had to replace it. This makes better smoothies.  I was surprise.,3

5,Great Blender!!!,31-May-12,Yes,"I enjoy this every day, no matter what I put in it, it chews it up and makes some tasty treats...",0
5,"Good, but needs water",23-Nov-09,Yes,"I am new to blending and this is my first professional grade machine.  I am happy with it, but one thing I was not expecting is that often I have to add water to my fruits and veggies.  Even if I am just doing a frozen fruit juice.  Its okay I guess, this is perhaps elementary, I was just not aware.  If I don't add water, it will just spin at the bottom like a $20 blender. I am getting better, I bought an additional book with recipes and online there is a lot of stuff too.  I make a great Jamba Juice drink now that is really good, which is not necessarily a healthy drink but great drink on a hot summer. And concerning healthy drinks, which is what we bought it for, you do need to read up on it.  You can't just throw in 5 fruits and 5 veggies.  It will be just about undrinkable and you are not supposed to really mix fruits and veggies.  After about a month's worth of use, we expect to use this regularly, every other day for the long term..Finally, the machine itself is very good.  Quality is good, easy to use and clean. Durability is high and machine overall seems very solid. Looks pretty good in the kitchen too.  Certainly better than a deep frying machine.  As I am writing this, my 8 year old daughter overlooking my shoulder insisted that I add that even she likes it.",7

5,Happy with Blendtec,18-Apr-12,Yes,"After reading rave reviews of Blendtec blenders for two years, I saved up and ordered one. I am so glad I did- it makes really smooooooth smoothies (and I put in a lot of rough greens) and great ice cream. The recipe for pistachio ice cream that comes with the Blendtec is amazing!!  It is a little loud, but the smoothies are worth it.",3
5,blentec = love,22-Dec-13,Yes,LOVE IT! works like no other blender and has a 7 yr warranty! I own a small restaurant in which I use my Blentec almost daily. It makes my job easier and faster when making sauces and salsas!,1
5,pretty good for busy life,22-May-12,Yes,"I don't like eating fruits, and hate to clean the kitchen for more than half an hour. The blender is perfect for me.

2,Not a replacement for a VitaMix!,17-Mar-14,Yes,"You don't have a lot of control. All buttons are pre-programmed.. CON: Its basically an overpriced garden variety blender. I've had it over two years, and very seldom find ANY use for it. I miss my VitaMix that I thought this would replace..PRO: the design of the container cover is excellent! No spilling, easy peasy to clean!",2

5,Great blender!,27-May-12,Yes,"We have this blender about a month and we've been very pleased.  We primarily use it for making fruit smoothies and frozen drinks.  It is a little bit loud, but the trade off is worth it.  Every time, our smoothies come out perfect.  The smoothie button has become out best friend.",0

1,So disappointed,20-Feb-18,Yes,"I had really high hopes for this blender. But honestly my ninja blended better. I follow the instructions but every time I want to make a smoothie I have to stip it,stir it and start it over and over because it locks up and stops blending. Even after all of that it leaves large chunks of bananas and dates. Very disappointing!",2

It's an amazing feeling going from having a blender that struggles with ice, to having a blender where I have to ask myself ""what can't I blend?"". It's an incredibly useful tool.

I've had it for about two years now and it is having a hard time even making smoothies. I am really disappointed because I spent a lot of money on it and Blendtecs are supposed to be the best. Kind of bummed. The motor sounds like its going to die every time I use it.",1

3,"Powerful, but lid insert is dangerously loose, so use with caution",7-Dec-17,Yes,"This blender is very powerful, which is both good and, as I found out, potentially dangerous. First, the good. It is very powerful and blends things right up.  It turns hard ice into snow so fast, it stays completely dry. It totally eviscerates fruits and vegetables. Will it blend? Sure looks like it. However, there is a serious design flaw. While the lid fits very tightly, the little transparent insert in the lid is very loose. It takes very little pressure to remove. This showed itself to be a serious safety issue for me. I was making carrot soup, where I boiled carrot chunks in broth until soft, then put in the blender to puree. There were several inches between the top of the liquid and the top of the blender jar. I used manual mode to blend the soup. I had my hand loosely on the jar cover, as I usually do when blending things. When the motor engaged, it pushed the liquid up into the lid so forcefully that the center plastic piece came out, spraying my hand with hot liquid and making quite a mess before I was able to turn it off. This seems like a serious design flaw. On every other blender I have ever owned, the lid insert had a locking mechanism requiring a quarter twist to remove it. Luckily I was uninjured but I am considering returning the blender because of this issue.",2

5,Best bender ever,8-Nov-09,Yes,My wife has a smoothie almost every day and we have gone through 4 blenders in the last 4 years.  Each one was more expensive than the last.  They all burned out in less than a year. The Blentec works as advertised.  It is quick but loud. It has more power than any blender I have ever seen and I expect it to last for a very long time. Cost is the only big negative.,4

5,This thing is just crazy good!,23-Jan-17,Yes,"I've used this brand several times for bar tending in the past, and it is amazing.  Amazon had a sick deal on it: 237.99 brand new straight from Amazon - not a refurbished product!..If you ever see it at that price, grab it!..This is superior to the Vitamix in one VERY important regard: It is shorter and as a result actually fits on my counter under the upper cabinets!  Vitamix does not!..Otherwise the two are very similar and both are worth a purchase, but the shorter Blendtec was my preference.  That and the fact that I have abused them bar tending and they continue working like champs!",3
5,The best blender we have ever had,4-Apr-15,Yes,"The best blender we have ever had...works seamlessly with any food items I place the blender. I was hesitant about paying so much, but it has exceeded our expectations.",1
1,I am so out of love with Blendtec,23-Jun-16,Yes,"I am so out of love with Blendtec.  I have never written an Amazon review before but I feel very strongly that no one should buy this product.  A few years ago I bought two of them, a couple of months apart from Amazon.  They get the same amount of use.  But I have gone through four jars on one.  The other is still going strong with the original jar.  Blendtec does not acknowledge this defect. They should replace my motor instead of making me buy a replacement jar every year but unlike Vitamix (anecdoctal from friends' experiences) their warranty does not cover this.  I will not spend another $100 for another jar and can't afford a vita mix right now so ninja is it is.",12
5,I highly recommend this blender,1-Mar-16,Yes,"I highly recommend this blender. I ruined the motors in several good, expensive blenders trying to blend up ice or frozen fruit in smoothies before biting the bullet and getting a Blendtec. It's expensive, but it's worth it. If you love this blender it will love you back. A million smoothies later it is still going strong. I will probably never have to buy another blender, but if I do, it will be a Blendtec.",1
3,Missed programmed buttons!,26-Dec-16,Yes,"Bought this blender for wife for Christmas. The next morning she unbox it, set it out on her kitchen counter and plugged it in to try it out. When she push the different setting buttons like the soup button, the LED screen would show that she had pushed the ice cream button. So she continued to try the other buttons and the same thing would happen. Beside that the blender seem to work fine. Just not sure what setting she was using because the LED read something different then the buttons she would pushing.",0
5,I love this blender!,12-May-07,Yes,"I know the $400 price tag is a bit much to digest at first, but its well worth the money for this magical blender. For anyone who is serious about their blending this is a must have for the kitchen or bar. I bought a book called ""Greens for life"" along with the blender and it has changed my life for the better. GET THIS BLENDER!",12

5,Amazing Blender,14-Jul-13,Yes,"Bought this blender to make my green smoothies after my cuisinart blender bit the dust after using it to blend up kale and spinach after 3 months.  This blender is super powerful and I have used it to make the green smoothies, regular smoothies, slushees, and frozen margaritas with no problems what so ever.  It is a little pricey, but the quality of the motor and the 7 year warranty does ease my mind with spending that much for the blender.",1
5,Blendtec Blender,17-Aug-10,Yes,"This is a terrific product - and it fits under my cabinets!.I especially like it for blending whole food juices and for making ice cream. The only down-side is that the motor is loud, so wear ear protection. I purchased one for myself and one for my daughter.",1

1,I'm Melting!!!!,2-Oct-13,Yes,"My blender smoked- melted the rubber and left chunks of rubber in my smoothie.  All after less that 25 uses.  Are you kidding me.  For this money it should not have burned out quite so quickly.  It was a smoothy- made of frozen fruits, juice and soy milk.  UNREAL!!!  I am writing to the company.  This is the Blendtec TB-621-20 Total blender.",29

From the beginning I smelled a plastic, burning odor that would come and go. I've had this for almost 2 years and I used it today, the plastic/burning odor lasted in my apartment for an hour it was so strong and I'm sure toxic to inhale.

1,Do not buy a Blendtec,10-Oct-13,Yes,"We have owned a Blendtec for just over 3 years and the seal on the jar went bad 2 times. We spent $ 520.00 on this blender with a 3 year warranty from Amazon.  Now even the motor is tripping the electrical outlet every time we use it.  Blendtec offered to send us a refurbished motor and jar for $185.00.  Our warranty now longer applies.  We purchased this blender because of its size and power and loved it while it worked except for the noise. What a waste of some hard earned money..Now we purchased a top of the line Vitamix, the new smaller size with a 10 year warranty on the motor and the jar.  It cost us 750.00 with the extended warranty.  This Vitamix does not rattle the house like the Blendtec did. It is all around bigger easy to use and it blends like a charm.  Vitamix has a much better reputation and track record.  Do not waste your money like we did on a Blendtec.",15
5,The Blendtec vs. Vita-Mix dilemma,7-Apr-09,Yes,"I must give you a little bit of history before reviewing the Blendtec . . ..Our local Costco was having a Vita-Mix road show and i bought it knowing that I really liked everything I had ever read about a Blendtec.  A couple of my friends raved about the Vita-Mix, so I felt I needed to pay a little attention.  A large purchase like this deserved a little research so that I wouldn't have any regrets.  I watched the demo, was impressed and took home the Vita-Mix that day.  I was anxious to make a smoothie with it because I had been using the Magic Bullet for five months.  I made my first smoothie with it, and it turned out great but the ""honeymon"" didn't last very long.  I did not like the sheer size of the Vita-Mix!  It sat VERY high on my counter, wouldn't fit under the cabinet and it looked like it belonged in a commercial-sized kitchen, not mine.  I absolutely disliked everything about the lid, except the ability to drizzle liquids in from the opening.  The lid was not easy to put on nor remove.  And the tamper!!!  A good machine should not require a tamper to push the food around.  The blender canister has these decorative grooves on the sides and oh what difficulty to ""get every last bit out"" with a a rubber scraper.  I felt like I was wasting food!  Then, I made a vegetable pate and the 4-pronged blade made it extremely difficult to get the food hiding below the blade.  By this time, I had had enough and was only too happy to take it back to Costco...That same night, I ordered my Blendtec.  It arrived promptly and have LOVED everything about it since Day One!  It is so-o-o-o easy to ""get every last bit out"" because the sides of the blender doesn't have the unnecessary decorative grooves on the side.  It makes a big difference if you're the type that doesn't like to waste.  I feel that the Vita-Mix and Blendtec are equally noisy, but it does its job so quickly and efficiently that it really isn't on for very long.  It is so efficient and powerful that it doesn't need a silly tamper to get everything blended well.  It fits under my cabinet where I like to keep it and it is just perfect in every way.  I make whole fruit and/or leafy green smoothies, sometimes twice a day, and it's always smooth and perfectly blended.  As long as you add the proper amount of liquid, that ""vortex"" forms and everything gets pulled downwards.  Everything i make just comes out absolutely perfect.  I just can't say enough good things about this machine.","1,945"

I poured out the contents and noticed it had tiny bits of rubber in it! Wasted my food, which is scarce until my next paycheck, and could have made me sick if I drank it.

2,In the long run it is many times more expensive than the vitamix??do the math,7-Jul-12,No,"Please read update below; it is a game-changer:..My honeymoon ended with this blender after 2 years, which up to this point my review would have been as glowing as the other 5 star reveiws. My suggestion is not to believe any review from someone who has not owned and used this mixer everyday for 2 years (which I have done). Bottom line: in 12 years this will cost you $300 more than the price you are paying. Here is why.....FACT: the seals will go on the blender top in 2 years if you use it daily.  Do not believe that this is the exception (in my reading of reviews, i often ignore the 1 star reviews thinking they are manufacturer flukes). THIS IS NOT THE CASE! Google it, read the reviews here and you will discover that there is a designflaw<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/OMNI-V-Blender-3-HP-Heavy-Duty-Professional-Multi-Speed-Timer-6-Knives-Blade/dp/B007CPLTBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OMNI V Blender 3 HP Heavy Duty Professional, Multi-Speed, Timer, 6 Knives Blade</a>??in the jar in the bottom seal which requires the jar to be replaced regularly. K-tel knows about the problem, and rather than paying for the huge expense of creating a new tooling machine to produce a new seal/blade, they extended the jar warranty from two years to three (which is not really addressing the problem, as it means you have to replace the $100 jar less frequently...I first started noticing the seal going as a black fluid started leaking from the bottom of the jar (i wondered, what is that???). Later, the seal itself started coming out in the jar (GROSS, i do not know how long i was drinking this fine black dust).I googled the problem, and saw that the jar has a design flaw, and this was not just aan occasional bad jar)...I believe that the reason that these amazon reviews are not littered with one star reviews for this blender is that most people do not use their blenders once or twice a day for two years (as we did). If you are an occasional user, the 3 year warranty could last a long time, but in time you will find out...and be ready to start pulling out $100 every 3 years...Note: I gave it two stars rather than one, as for the two years I had it, I loved it. Now my pocketbook wishes I had gotten the comparable (and in the long run a fraction of the cost) Vitamix...I have selfishly never done a review before(even though i read them all the time), but as a public service to everyone, take the time to pass this information on...7-18-2013 Update:.My new wildside jar is around a year old. So far so good. Also worth noting is  that this new jar does not get the use of my original, as now we only use it a few times a week. Also, the wider base and the larger blades do not put as much stress on the jar mechanics...If you do not hear another update from me, you can know things are still okay with my new top; I may get lucky. Otherwise, I promise to will keep you posted...11-9-2013.It was just brought to my attention that Amazon now sells another 3hp motor blender, the Omini V blender for more than $100 less than the Blendtec, If anyone personally has info on this, please post for me and others!..Update:12-23-2013.In one of the recent replies to my post, I was alerted that Blendtec now warranties the jars for 7 years (does not help me, but now makes my rating/review obsolete). Thanks Adam for the update...Closing notes: If you do have a jar problem (i believe the basic problem in tooling has not changed), you pay the shipping for replacement and will be without a jar for a while, but this small expense and inconvenience, imho, is worth the risk of possibly getting a bad jar (which DOES happen)! I would recommend getting it with a Wildside jar, which seems to have less complaints than the regular jar. At a year and a half, I have not had any problems my Wildside. I cannot change the rating, but this now closes this jar issue (with my recommendation to buy only with a Wildside, and not regular jar).","2,102"
1,Not impressed.,13-Apr-15,Yes,This item had to be exchange 3 times from the maker in Utah. Also Costco had it for over $100. less with a smaller blender included. I felt ripped off. Costco also had them in red also.And they were the newer model. I still am not impressed for the money.,2
4,"If you're going to get a Blendtec, make sure you have the Twister jar and right user interface",20-Jan-18,No,"First let me start off by saying that I owned a Blendtec Designer Series (the original model) and I currently own a Vitamix 5200. So I will be able to compare these two machines via my own personal experience with these machines. I am a person who uses my blender for everything; from making smoothies, nut-butters, flours, batters, milks, etc I have extensive experience using both the Vitamix and Blendtec blenders (in the case of the Blendtec, I also had experience with the Twister Jar so I'll be making some comments about that as well)...You might be wondering why I am writing a review for the Total Blender if the original Designer Series is the model I had. I am writing for this model for a few reasons. First, I did have a review for the Designer Series, but Amazon got rid of that review because I didn't purchase through them (and now for some reason they will only accept views on certain models only if you're a verified buyer or Vine reviewer). Second, because there are gripes I have with other Blendtec models, which I will compare to this model. And third, for all practical purposes, this model and the Designer series (along with most other Blendtec) are the exact same machine. Most Blendtec models all sport the exact same motor (the same 1560 watt motor) and all Blendtec machines are compatible with all the jars (meaning regardless of which Blendtec model you have, any jar will work)...So with that, what I like about the Blendtec is that this is one of the most powerful blenders you can buy. It is the only blender on the market that is a true competitor to the Vitamix. I don't mean that just in terms of blend quality, but also in it's versatility (especially with the Twister jar), build quality, warranty (a full 8 year warranty), and the level of support. Blendtec is constantly updating their website for recipes, coming out with new containers (which are generally less expensive than Vitamix containers by an appreciable amount) to improve blending experience, etc. And like the Vitamix, Blendtec is made in America...Smoothies (and similar concoctions): For blend quality, this is the machine to get. Your smoothies will come out silky smooth almost every time you make something in this machine. It is the only machine that is targeted for residential use that truly produces Vitamix-like quality. Some blenders can come close, but Blendtec hardly takes a back seat to the Vitamix. The only time I have ever noticed that Vitamix can blend ever-so-slightly smoother than the Blendtec is with things like dates or blackberry seeds. Don't get me wrong, the Blendtec does a marvelous job. But it might have to be run for another 30 seconds longer to truly pulverize these ingredients. Other than in these instances, you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference in blend quality. If the Vitamix's blend quality is a 10 then a Blendtec would probably be about a 9.5+. (And I want to be clear that I am splitting hairs here. In reality, if I handed you a smoothie made with dates or blackberries from a Blendtec, you wouldn't be thinking, ""Oh, that's definitely not the Vitamix!"" The difference can really only be noticed if you're consciously thinking about it and comparing the two blenders... this is of course provided that you used the equivalent settings on both blenders)...This basically means for smoothies, frappes, or milkshakes, the two machines are virtually indistinguishable in terms of blending things into a smooth texture. And since these things are what most people use their blender for, most people would not be able to tell much difference between the two machines...Flours: Blendtec can grind things like rice into rice flour that is so fine that you can easily bake with it. It feels every bit as fine as the flour you'd buy at a store. This is very nice when you need flour but you don't really feel like going to the store. If you have any rice (or anything else that can be ground into flour) on hand, then you can turn it into rice flour in less than 1 minute. Just put 1 cup into the Blendtec, hit the highest speed and it will shut off after 50 seconds. And what you're left with is flour fine enough to bake with. Vitamix can do this too, and the result will be comparable to the Blendtec's result. In this area, both machine are about equal in their performance...Food processing: Vitamix gives you greater control over the speed of the blade for food processing. At the lowest Vitamix speed, the blade spins at about 500 rpms. This allows the Vitamix to be used as a food processor without over blending. This means I can drop a carrot or an onion in the Vitamix and mince it without turning it into mush. Unfortunately the lowest speed on the Blendtec is approximately 4000 rpms, which makes it far too fast to easily be used as a food processor. Also, the dull thick blades on the Blendtec make it so it doesn't really cut things very well on the lowest speed making it more difficult for it to nicely mince up produce. To make matters worse, the wide square design of the Blendtec jar makes it difficult to work with low volume ingredients (hence one of the reasons Blendtec came out with the mini-Wildside container or the Twister jars). So for food processing, Vitamix is definitely the better machine to get...Thick concoctions (nut butters, ice creams): this is where the Vitamix truly shows its strength vs. the Blendtec. First off, let me tell you that if the reason you're thinking of the Blendtec over the Vitamix is because you have this idea that the Blendtec does not need a tamper, then get that thought out of your mind as soon as possible. This is a marketing claim by Blendtec, but in practice, it is not true at all. And Blendtec knows it, which is why they invented the Twister jar...With the Vitamix, because of the tamper, along with the Vitamix's relatively narrow jar design, you can turn 2-3 cups of nuts into nut-butter in about 1 to 2 minutes using the tamper. This is because with the tamper, you can redirect the nuts back into the cutting path of the blades. With the Blendtec, things aren't so simple. If you put 2 cups of nuts into the Blendtec, you'll find that eventually the Blendtec blades will become ineffective after a few seconds because all the nuts are no longer in the cutting path of the blade (this is called cavitation; it's basically when a ""pocket"" forms around the blades and they are just spinning in the air without actually blending anything). Since the Blendtec doesn't have a tamper, you must stop the machine, use a spatula to redirect all the nuts back into the blade, start it again, and repeat this cycle until you get the results you want. Basically, by the time you are able to make the nut-butter (or any other type of thick/dense recipe) in the Blendtec you'd have to have stopped the machine at least half a dozen times or so...If you have the Twister jar, thick concoctions like nut-butters become a lot easier to deal with because the special lid on the Twister redirects ingredients back into the cutting path of the blades. But this means you have to stand in front of the machine, and turn the twisting mechanism (which many people find awkward) vigorously to get the consistency you want. So much for not needing a tamper. So much for ""Push a button and walk away"". And the Twister jar is sold separately for $100+... so why didn't Blendtec simply create a $20 tamper for its customers? Well, my suspicion is because Blendtec has bashed the idea of a tamper so much, that I think they needed to create the Twister (instead of producing a $20 tamper) to keep from having too much egg on their face. Unfortunately the customer loses in this case (but to salvage this situation, often an older model [or basic model] Blendtec + Twiser can be purchased for approximately the same price as a Vitamix)...As for ice creams, Blendtec can make ice creams, but in a standard jar (like the Fourside or Wildside) you will have to master how much liquid ingredients versus frozen ingredients to put into the machine and then use the ice cream cycle. However, this can be done, but without the proper ratio of liquid to frozen ingredients, the machine will not be able to truly produce an ice cream-like texture. Too much liquid will result in a smoothie/slushy. Too little liquid will result in the machine not being able to blend the ingredients, due to cavitation. The nice thing about the Vitamix is that you don't have to master this ""liquid to frozen"" ratio. In fact, with the Vitamix, you can put in 100% frozen ingredients, and thanks to the tamper, you can turn those frozen ingredients into a nice ice cream or fruit sorbet. The Blendtec can do this with the Twister jar. Without it, if you have too many frozen ingredients, you'll be in the same situation you were with nut-butters...Durability: Blendtec is well made, but they have an on-going problem with the gaskets in their jars leaking. This isn't a rare occurrence either. Almost anyone who has used the Blendtec regularly for at least a year has had this problem happen to them before. It happened to mine. Fortunately, Blendtec has recently redesigned their jars to hopefully eliminate this problem all together, but this is a recent change, so time will tell whether or not this problem is a thing of the past...Blendtec models: for the most part, most Blendtec models are identical as far as the guts of the machine is concerned. Except for a couple higher end models, all Blendtecs have a 1560 watt motor, and are compatible with any jar they have. With Vitamix, not all the jars are compatible with every model, unfortunately. This means no matter which Blendtec motor base you have, you can use any Blendtec jar. So you never have to worry that, ""I have xxx model Blendtec, can I use a Twister or mini Wildside with it""--the answer is yes, you can...However, there is something really annoying that Blendtec has done with their blenders. And that is, there can be a great difference in the user interfaces of the different models. For example, this blender is the Blendtec Total Blender with 10 variable speeds and 6 pre-programmed settings. This is the model that Blendtec has based most of their recipes off of. Unlike the Total Blender's 10 manual speeds, my Designer Series had 8 manual speeds. So when a Blendtec recipe said something like, ""Blend on speed 5 for 20 seconds, then ramp up to speed 10,"" how exactly does this translate on my machine?..Newer Blendtec recipes try to avoid such precise speed settings and instead will say something like, ""Start off on low speed, and then speed up to medium-high"" --however, what if you have the Blendtec 570 model which only had low, medium and high speed? It wasn't capable of a ""medium-high"" speed...Even the pre-programmed settings can cause confusion. Because some Blendtec recipes will call for using the ""whole juice"" setting, but what if you have a Blendtec 575 which does not have a whole juice preset? These types of situations create a lot of confusion for Blendtec owners (who do not own the Total Blender, which by the way has been discontinued by Blendtec) who are trying to follow recipes that were originally designed using a different Blendtec model than the one they have...So keep these things in mind when you're selecting the right Blendtec for you. And one last point, the pre-programmed settings. If you follow the Blendtec recipes exactly as they are, you'll almost always come out with a perfect blend. If you veer off and start doing your own thing, however, then all bets are off. Here's a tip: when you're not following a Blendtec specific recipe, ignore the smoothie button and use the whole juice button instead (this is of course assuming your Blendtec has a whole juice setting). The whole juice button is a longer blend cycle and it blends at faster speeds than the smoothie button does. In my opinion, Blendtec should do away with the smoothie pre-set and just use the whole juice button. Or even better yet, use the manual controls...So my opinion on the Blendtec is that if you never plan to make thick concoctions like nut butters, then it is a fine machine. But if you do plan to do things like this, then life without the Twister jar will be very difficult. With the Twister jar, the Blendtec is a fine machine with a great warranty. With the Twister jar I'd give the Blendtec 4.5 stars, but without the Twister, I'd give it more like a 3 star rating.",5
4,It will blend.,12-Aug-07,Yes,Product works great.  Product is very well built and holds up well so far.,2
1,Do you like eating plastic?,26-May-12,No,"We have had our blender for about two years, and I have rated it a four until today.  It was previously a five until the blades would not turn as rapidly, and I figured that we had worn it down and would need to see how well the warranty works.  But as of today, it is a less than a one.  Beware that if you use it often, at some point you will smell something burning, and discover black pieces of plastic hovering around in your smoothie, or other blended food - if you are lucky and do not drink first and discover that you have ingested it.  Read the one star posts, and you will find that this is the way that the product works.  It is inevitable.  One can only wonder how much plastic you ingest before it becomes noticeable.  The plastic fixture that houses the blades inside the pitcher eventually gives way, sending pieces of plastic spiraling into your food.  The eventual warning is a burning smell that you will assume is coming from the blender housing - not the pitcher.  Upon close investigation, and small hard things in something that is supposed to be a smooth smoothie, you will find that the plastic piece that is holding the plastic inside the pitcher has gone south and is breaking down inside your food.  Of course, now I believe that this has been going on ever since the blades stopped turning as rapidly, but the plastic shards were too small to notice.  Perhaps the company could have a better design, but that would cut down on profits.  Besides, a little plastic may do us and our children some good...Ministerlou",145
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM: VERY DISAPPOINTED,20-Jun-16,Yes,"My friends encouraged me to buy this item over a Vitamix. It DOES NOT MAKE SMOOTHIES! I am following directions and can not get it to chop ice, frozen bananas, frozen fruit, etc. I need to run it about 10 times before things start to happen. Regret this decision and too late  to return in. Go for the Vitamix instead.",3
1,The blade will eventually seize and you will buy multiple jars,9-Aug-13,No,"Great blenders ... until the jar breaks. Jar sales are probably a pretty brisk recurring income for the manufacturer. Have a 25 year old VitaMix with original metal canister with spigot and it keeps going and going (Kids use it at their house)... NO EXCUSE that a Blendtec jar cannot do the same at this price point. In 8 years we are on the fourth jar (with average 4 times a week use). After the first fail Blendtec said we did not care for it properly. Second one we kept out of the dishwasher, rinsed and dried by hand immediately to keep moisture from soaking into the blade bushing and were generally up tight about caring for the jar, NO DIFFERENCE, it died at 30 months. Going back to Vitamix. This is going on ebay.",49
5,Great smoothie blender?,5-Nov-16,No,"We?€?ve owned this blender for about a year now and have logged 417 uses (easily made over 350 smoothies). I use it to make a smoothie most mornings with milk, fresh banana, egg white powder, and frozen fruit. It?€?s the frozen fruit that has been a problem with previous blenders. The Blendtec grinds down frozen strawberries, mangos, peaches, and berries easily. I use the smoothie button which has a pre-programmed sequence of speeds across a one-minute cycle with an auto shutoff at the end. I almost always abbreviate the cycle because it ground up everything before the minute was up. My wife uses the Blendtec occasionally for cooking to blend nuts and puree foods...I was skeptical after watching the videos on how easy it was to clean. But it is that simple. After pouring out my smoothie, one squirt of dishwashing soap, fill with a bit of water while rinsing the jar walls, then a few seconds of pulse cycle. Fruit particles and occasional undissolved protein powder that stuck to the walls of the jar washes off. Every once in a while I need to manually remove something off the jar, but typically everything is washed off the jar walls and just a rinse is needed to get the soap suds out. Easy and quick...This Blendtec blender has a direct drive motor which enables programmable control unlike the old analog motors where motor speeds were set manually. So once I start it, I can walk away and do other things (like put away the frozen fruit, etc. while it?€?s blending). The Blendtec has six pre-programmed sequences and three manual control buttons. The motor is so powerful that the blades aren?€?t knife-sharp like our last blender. The power and speed of the motor (not the sharpness of the blades) is what blends and grinds up food. The motor is so powerful that we don?€?t stop a cycle to rearrange food inside, and we don?€?t use a tool to press food down while blending. Everything gets drawn down to the blades for even and smooth blending without any additional assistance...The jar is lightweight (not heavy glass like our last blender). The lid seals tightly. The base is substantially heavy to prevent the blender from ?€?walking?€? or wobbling. The ?€?connection?€? between the base (motor) and jar (blades) is all metal (unlike two blenders ago that was plastic and wore out quickly). The square shape of the jar makes it easy to pour, and somehow it helps blend foods well...It?€?s easy to clean the base because the buttons are the smooth kind like on most microwave ovens. One wipe with a sponge or paper towel keeps the base clean. I use the measurement markings on the side of the jar to fill it. It?€?s powerful, but it?€?s loud...Works very well. Modern technology. Easy to clean. Solid and reliable.",4
1,Not made for smoothies!! #fail,1-Nov-14,Yes,"After only 3 uses making smoothies this blender started giving off a smell that was like burning rubbers. On the fourth use it ""overheated"" shut off and started to smoke. If your planning on using this for smoothies think twice!! #fail",3
1,Great concept. Poor quality,16-Nov-17,No,"Great concept.  Poor quality, poor QA testing, poor customer service.  I just got off the phone with Blendtec to report my problem.  The plastic piece that connects the blade to the ""jar"" fell apart while making a smoothie.  It started smoking and spewing the smoothie out.  It only has a count of 107 on it for quantity of times used...They should have offered more for the trouble and hassle (time spent on the phone with them, clean up, food wasted, time without a blender), etc...With a competitive market, you guys don't get it.  You don't understand the value of customer service.  Back to customer service school, Anna.",19
5,"Great blender, but buy hearing protection to go with it!",6-Feb-07,Yes,"This is an awesome blender.  It blends stuff like you've never seen before and I am really pleased with it.  But holy cow is it LOUD!!  The cat hates me.  I got a pair of earmuffs from the shooting supply place to wear while using it.  Maybe overkill, but I think that using it twice a day without them would result in hearing damage eventually.  I wish they sold an enclosure for this one like they do for the commercial ones....I'd definitely buy one...I bought this because I had a juicer and liked it.  But I felt that tossing all that pulp and fiber had to be making me miss out on a lot of health benefits. And just trying to spoon some of it back into the juice doesn't work, it's gross.  This blender blends whole fruits and vegetables wonderfully, I can still get the fiber and in a drinkable form...After I bought this, I read a webpage where they talked about blending an avocado WITH the pit, and I tried it.  It works, I ended up with an amazingly smooth mousse-like creamy pudding.  Not something I'd do every day, but it was very interesting.  I have been making kale banana blueberry smoothies for breakfast and it blends everything into one homogenous shake.  No bits of leaves, chunks of stuff, etc.  I'm enjoying it.  I just wish it wasn't so loud.",545
4,Another Blendtec v. Vitamix Comparison,19-Nov-13,No,"Spending this much on a blender you really want it to be everything you have seen in the demos and more.  I read and read and researched.  Went to road shows and watched endless video blogs...Cost was the final consideration...  Everything I read basically said that both blenders are 98% the same...  They do things slightly differently but end result was the same except for very thick blends...  Then the vitamix edges out the blendtec...In comes the Wildside jar and Twister jar...two items that are supposed to help ""fix"" the few minor gripes people have with the Blendtec.  I read all about the Twister jar and how great it is...and how easy it is to do nut butters and hummus now...I read all about the Wildside jar and how it creates a much better vortex...sucking everything down and into the blade without the ugly tamper thing...First, so I don't come off negative...  The hummus makes Sabre and Tribe store hummus taste like card board.  This was the hummus I remember when I was in the middle east.  Absolutely fantastic.  So quick and easy.  Want it a little bit course...thorw in a hand full of chickpeas and pulse a few times.  Black bean Hummus, chick pea hummus...all great...Soups...  OMG.  So good.  They are not exactly like normal soups...they are airy and creamy...not really the same consistency but they are delicious and frankly soups of this quality with the limited ingridents they take...most are 4-6 ingridents...are awesome.  I made cream of broccoli soup tonight and it consisted of chicken soup, milk, broccoli and a two spices...wonderful.  Mushroom walnut ...wow.  Loved the sweat potato soup as well.....Ice creams / sorbet have been hit and miss...and smoothies I am still trying to find the right mix after 2 plus weeks...My frustration comes in when the Blendtec refuses to blend some of the ingridents...which happens more often than you would really think.  (25% of the time)...  They get stuck on top or something and will not be sucked down...no matter how many times i hit pulse or stop it and then try again.  Tonight I made the Pina Colada virgin and I had two big chunks of ice...no matter what I tried I could NOT get the big chunks blended.  It really frustrated me...The wildside jar I like...  The twister jar really does not seem to deliver for me...just smaller and the blades really don't force the food into the blade.  It does clean the sides but that is about it.  I have resorted to using a spatchula as a sort of tamper which I can see as semi dangerous with the blades moving as fast as they do...I also not happy about having to add as much liquid to everything...  Smoothies have to have a fair amount of water, juice or milk added...  I would much prefer liquefying the veggies...but the Blendtec needs something to start the vortex...or it will not mix...Some of this is due to my inexperience...  I think tonight I used the wrong jar for the Pina Colada ...I should have used the wildside not the twister.  Some of it has to deal with getting to know the machine and finding the right recipes...Also, I had one time where after the soup heated up enough and got airy enough one of the pulse ups blew the lid off because the liquid had expanded during mixing (heat and airiness) to be enough to force the lid off...Please don't get me wrong...the machine is a great machine but these little things are adding up for me.  I am strongly debating to get a vitamix...Although everyone pretty much says these are 98% the same Vitamix vs. Blendtec...almost every post says all things being equal I would go with the Vitamix EXCEPT for the fact:  1)  The jars suck and don' fit under cabinet (fixed now...on most models)  and it is hard to get all your food out of the jar (again fixed now for most part with newer jars)...For 380 dollars (two jars included - Wildside and Twister) this thing should be rock solid...  Right now I would only give 4 starts....  I went with Blendtec because I liked no tamper, presets, dull blade and COST which is about 300 dollars less with the two jars included.  (Compared to the 750 Pro)...Debating now to return the Blendtec and try the Vitamix...  I may even just pick up the 5200 and then return one or both to Costco...  I don't like abusing the policy but I am really trying to find a tool that does everything I want flawlessly....from 400 dollar is to 600 dollars for a blender...these things should be spot on perfect...Now my wife fought me on yet another kitchen gadet that is worthless  and way too expensive...but after the soups and hummus she is on board now.  When I told her I am thinking of spending 200 MORE for the vitamix she didn't blink.  I think that says something about how useful these tools really are...One last note...  I do have the Ninja...  I got it last summer on in store clearance at Walmart for 40 bucks.  It is nice for allot of things but green smoothies it struggles.  Things with ice it probably does better than the Blendtec...  Those sharp blades are a real negative for us and the pre-programed buttons help allot too...Anyway...not sure I really added to this very very old discussion and debate, but I hope you have found my review helpful.",9
3,Not a 3 HP blender,2-Aug-11,Yes,"This blender works out fine but for those who would want to purchase a 3 HP blender, this is NOT the one. The description here is kinda misleading.",1
5,Years of Problem-Free Service,17-Aug-18,No,"I guess I'm adding this review because it seems like it's the relatively few folks who get a bad unit (and it happens with almost anything) who are understandably angry and post reviews to get their ""pound of flesh.""  I am sure that for every one of those folks, there are hundreds or thousands like me who never had a problem- and mostly don't bother to post a review.  So now here's a review from one of those folks...We have had our Blendtec Total Classic blender for several years now and we've made soup, ice cream - even ground up dried chilis for spice blends - and of course hundreds of smoothies without any problem ever.  Lots of fruit and yogurt smoothies for breakfast using frozen fruit,  and once we got our recipes down the end product had/has the perfect consistency and flavor...Things we like:  easy, automated, one- button operation; powerful motor; consistent product every time; reliability; versatility; ease of cleaning; classy appearance...Things which could be better: noise level (yeah, it's loud); stability (sometimes with big chunks of frozen fruits you need to hold the top down to keep the unit from vibrating on the counter)...Bottom line:  we're very happy with our Blendtec and we recommend it.",0
5,The third is a year old now and working fine. I suspect I'll have to buy the next ...,3-Jul-18,No,"There is only the VItamix I think that competes with this blender. You may not need this blender for some blending jobs...Several of my now ""signature"" dishes rely on this blender. I have developed several versions of what I call roasted root puree. Oven caramelized onions garlic carrots peppers leeks and just about anything else you can find in the vegetable bin. My tomatillo sauce is special. I make the healthiest version of cream shrimp and corn soup as well as a cream of asparagus to die for...After roasting the vegetables coated with olive oil simply blend adding enough vegetable broth or water to get a creamy texture. Taste it! If you are a cook, recipes will start forming how to use it!..Warranty, I bought mine at the a Sam's Club ""roadshow"" which promised an extra two years on the warranty. I think my warranty is close to completed. In the ten years I'm on my third jar. The first the blade got tight wasn't spinning freely. The second the blade got loose and started leaking. The third is a year old now and working fine. I suspect I'll have to buy the next one and they are expensive.  (I noted in another review about the top needing to be held, each of my replacements came with yet another better top.) Oh, each time I called for warranty service I had a new container shipped to me free within a couple minutes! No hassles. The failed containers went into the garbage.",0
5,The Honest Truth,25-May-12,No,"There are plenty of great reviews here about how extraordinary this blender is.  They list everything that it does and how it's changed their lives.  Suffice it to say that I agree with all of them and will skip mentioning all of that.  Here are a few things I don't see mentioned very much that I'd like to comment on.....1) When my Blendtec arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it came with a 213 page cookbook!  Not just a few recipes included with the manual, but a top quality, spiral bound, hard cover, beautifully illustrated, fun to page through, cookbook like you would buy for $20 in a bookstore.  The Tortilla Soup is fantastic and leftovers are great cold!..2) As for the whole Blendtec vs VitaMix thing... don't worry about it.  Most of that is just a Hatfield and McCoy feud of ego and pride.  I get so tired of reading about the war between the two!  No matter which one you have, you'll love it and swear by it.  They both work beautifully unless you get the occasionally factory defected one.  That happens.  Suck it up and just get it replaced.  It doesn't mean that every blender of that particular brand is defected!  They both perform amazing feats of culinary wonders.  The differences are only a matter of personal preferences...3)  The complaints about how ""noisy"" the Blendtec is are over-exaggerated.  It's only slightly noisier than a regular blender or food processor.  I'm certainly not covering my ears or running from the room!  (And neither does my cat.)..4)  This one is just a personal pet peeve:  Blenders don't ""juice.""  Even if the manual says it does, it doesn't.  There's a difference between a juicer and a blender.  You can blend a carrot into a drinkable form, but that's not juicing.  It's a smoothie.  Juicing separates the juice from the pulp.  When the pulp is fully included, it's a smoothie.  Yes, the fiber from smoothies is good for you and beneficial.  But, so is juicing.  There are benefits from juicing that you CAN'T get from smoothies.  And, as for the pulp being wasted (when you juice), it's only wasted if YOU waste it.  It can be used in compost, farm animal feed (if you live on a farm), or used to make other things such as pet food, vegetable soup, vegetable broth or dehydrated and made into healthy snacks and crackers...Here are MY reasons for my preference towards the Blendtec:..1)  The six handy-dandy preset buttons that do exactly what they say they'll do.  Toss the ingredients in, hit a button and you can walk away to continue cooking, cleaning, talking, etc.,  The blender automatically shuts itself off...2)  I also like the LED display that counts how many times you've used it.  How that's useful, I don't have a clue, but it's fun trivia!  It also displays a countdown in seconds until your food is ready...3)  The price.  Blendtec is about $100 or so cheaper than a VitaMix and performs the same functions...4)  The shape of the jar is much easier to get food out of.  No nooks and crannies or beveled edges (like the VitaMix) so there's less waste and it's easier to clean...The bottom line is, don't stress out over which blender is ""better.""  Both brands make foods creamy and smooth.  The differences are so small that when you finally buy either one, you'll love it.",25
3,Blendtec vs. Vitamix,6-Sep-14,Yes,"I bought a Blendtec and a Vitamix, to see which one would work best for my needs.  The blendtec did not do well the vitamin was wonderful, everything was blend smooth.  I have to say hands down the Vitamix won!",3
5,Two years later and still love it!!,21-Apr-16,No,"We bought our blender two years ago from Costco - they give an extra year on the warranty.  Either here or there, Blendtec runs a deal at Christmas time. I wish knew that before we bought so just FYI...We have used our blender at least 734 times - it doesn't count if you end in the middle of a cycle.  I have food allergies and need to make the majority of my food so this was an investment, but a well deserved one. If I never used it again I would feel like I have gotten my money's worth. I have also been interested in buying a second smaller jar. The Blendtec rep told me the price on their website and 2 places I can get it cheaper and which jar was the best deal for what I want to make with it- BB&amp;B 20% off coupon here I come!..So yes, my jar is failing (like you read in the 1.Star posts). I didn't know about this issue when I bought it. I had one time of smoke and haven't used it since. I went online to fill out the short warranty questionnaire, received an email about 48 hours later with the customer service number and my account tnumber to call. The rep listened over the phone and confirmed it is the jar and is sending us a new one. I have NEVER had a warranty replacement this easy. Plus I still have 6 years of warranty left...My family has owned several businesses and my dad always said the best way to see if a company is good is not when things are fine, it's when there's a problem. That's why I like Amazon (and Costco) and why I will enjoy pressing that start button even a little more when my new jar comes. I'll have to live without cream of asparagus soup (veggie broth, creamer, asparagus, salt, pepper and bam!) for another week or so but I'll get a shiny new jar too so it's a trade off!",4
4,"Very Powerful, Loud, Automatic, Loving it!",5-Dec-10,No,"This is a powerhouse in a small-ish package. The Vitamix (and I've owned two) are tall, also powerful but bulky and didn't have the ease of use of this one [no I didn't like the tamper or the fact that it had two containers for two purposes (grind vs blend) but I DID like the variable speed control]...Now, especially with pre-programmed automatic buttons for smoothies and whole juice, I am very happy with this Blendtec so far...A few things about it do not allow me to make it a full five stars but maybe more like 4.5...First: The very first time I used it, I tried a smoothie and had ice cubes in the mix, and the container started getting marked up from them. I am wondering at what point the container will become opaque from all the blending marks? @$55-65 a pop, I'm not eager to get a new one soon...Second: I do not feel like I can walk away from this machine, even on one of its auto cycles, because it moves around lightly on the counter and the container does not stay solidly locked into the base enough to where I feel like it needs a steadying hand on it...Otherwise, I am very pleased with the results: whole juice drinks are very smooth (even with the peels and/or seeds from raspberries). I even made a persimmon nectar from two whole persimmons (de-stemmed &amp; pitted) and just water and ice; gorgeous color and very smooth, and something I'd never had before...But I am still awed at the power. Watching this Blendtec turn whole fruit into fruit juice is to understand what respect for power means.",33
5,Blendtec Rocks Out Loud!,31-Jan-16,No,"I bought this blender at Costco and got an extra warranty for a great sale price! I have used it 14x and it is far the best blender I have ever owned. I train at a gym and my trainer has been bugging me for years to buy one. I have owned Oyster &amp; Black and Decker blenders before and they are an absolute joke compared to the Blendtec blender. I burned out 7 blenders in 5 years. Each blender cost about $70 so in essence I spent far more on blenders. If I would have just purchased this blender I would have saved money...All other blenders when you blend nuts, Chia seeds, Ginger root, Carrots; basically anything hard, tiny chunks would be around the blade. Instead of drinking my smoothie I would be eating it between sips.  The Blendtec blender crushes everything into liquid...It's amusing to hear as well. I put carrots, ginger root, Chia seeds, pineapple and ice in the blender. I can hear the ice and all the hard items bang around inside for about 8 seconds and then it's quiet, well it's still loud because of the blender, but no more banging around because everything has been turned into liquid. When I pour out my delicious smoothie I can oooh actually DRINK it!..I would also like to mention that this is a light blender. I carry it from my bedroom to the kitchen and once I am done creating my drink.  I hand wash it and dry it. This is my little baby and I am taking great care of it so it can take good care of me...Here is a delicious recipe: 2 chunks of Pineapple, 2 slices of Mango, 1 Scoop of Orac Green Powder (my trainer gives this to her children. She had it tested by a lab and it got excellent ratings), 1/2 cup of roasted cashews, 2 cups of Unsweetened Coconut Milk, ice, dash of Kal brand Stevia &amp; Sea salt and 2 tablespoons of Fennel seeds. Blend on 'Smoothie'.  Afterwards I pour my drink in a glass Voss water bottle, put it in the freezer and wash &amp; dry my Blender. Once I am done I grab my drink and wow what a delicious smoothie! Yummy! Thank you Blendtec you guys rock! :D..Another recipe that you will love!!!!.1 Green Apple (cored).1"" of Ginger Root (peeled).2 Lemons (peeled).Handful of Spinach.1 scoop of Orac Green Powder.Dash of Cayenne Pepper.Dash of Kal brand Stevia.Cold AquaHydrate Water (Aquahydrate water has a pH of 9).Option: If you want it really sweet add 1 packet of Lemonade Crystal Light powder packet.Blend. It will really wake you up! It is beyond delicious! Enjoy! :D",2
3,I gave it a fair shot...just not for me :(,9-Feb-15,No,"I tried to love this, I really did...Let me start by saying that yes, I own a Vitamix. I love it. It's larger and heavier than the Blendtec total Blender though, and I know I'd be devastated if anything happened to it, so when I saw a reconditioned Total Blender going for $229 on the largest bricks-and-mortar discount store's website, I knew I had to give it a shot. I thought this would be perfect to take on vacation, and though I'm a stay-at-home mom, I do run a twice-yearly consignment sale that occurs in a church, so I figured I could take this and leave it there for the week of my sale. I was so excited to get it I even paid ~$20 to get it overnight!..The day it came I jumped right in by attempting to make my own beeswax-based face cream. I of course melted the wax prior to blending the ingredients. What was supposed to have taken a few pulses to incorporate the oils and emulsify the cream took not one, not two...but FIVE full 90 second cycles. It did all come together in the end, but I had to scrape it and move it around several times to keep it from re-solidifying - it was a small, 3oz quantity and it seemed as if the Total Blender couldn't handle that little of an amount...Next came potato soup - something I've made in my Vitamix a number of times. This is where manual controls were sorely missed. For a blender that supposedly heats soups, it doesn't really make it much easier. Max 90 second cycles just aren't enough. I can put the ingredients in my Vitamix and keep an eye on the clock, knowing in approximately 5 minutes I'll see steam coming from the container and know it's done. Not so with the Total Blender - you have to push the soup button every 90 seconds for several cycles, and that was with hot-off-the stove broth (I usually use room temp). The end result was still just as good if not quite as effortless as what I make in my Vitamix...Now came what was the dealbreaker for me...THE LID BLEW OFF while I was cleaning it. I can only be grateful that it was soapy water that spewed over the kitchen and not the hot potato soup that I'd just finished making. And if you're questioning, yes, I know I had the lid all the way on because that was one of my initial concerns upon unboxing - I noticed that it didn't have a ""lip"" to fit the lid down over like the Vitamix does so I made a mental note that I'd need to make sure each time I used it that it was secure...The next few days, after recovering from the soapy water incident, I made a few smoothies. The taste and texture were perfectly acceptable; I would say the seeds were as pulverized and every bit as smooth as what I make in my Vitamix. No issues there. I will say that one cycle on the smoothie preset is not even close to being sufficient; it took 3-4 cycles to blend completely. Not a problem but it's another reason I prefer manual controls; makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong when it takes so much longer than it ""should"" ;-) (and I wasn't; I followed Blendtec's order of loading the pitcher from liquids to frozen)..In short, the QUALITY of what the Blendtec Total Blender makes is pretty much top-notch; it's just the performance of the machine I don't care for. The fit of the lid and the lack of manual control (90 second max cycles just seems silly) are dealbreakers for me, so even though I got a great deal, I still returned it.",3
5,"This blender costs too much, but I am still happy with my purchase",3-Sep-17,No,"I have been meaning to get one of these for years, but always turned off by the price. I got this on a great sale and have been using this almost daily for the past 2 months. I mostly use this for smoothies, purees, and homemade V8. I blasts through raw carrots and frozen fruit. A couple of times I did not have enough liquid and it was having trouble. So I just stopped it and added more liquid, problem solved. I have also used it for the wet portion of waffle/pancake mix and it has really helped to make the final batter more fluffy. Also clean up is a breeze: after a quick rinse add a few oz of water, couple drops of soap, pulse for 5-7 secs, and let dry...I like the presets on this unit and that it keeps a tally of how many times you have used it. Also this was short enough to fit under my cabinets on the kitchen counter...Now that I have used it I would buy it again if needed (but still not thrilled about the price). Thankfully it comes with an 8 year warranty. On the downside replacement/additional jars are around $100 a pop. Also this comes with the basic FourSide jar and not the new WildSide+ jar...Now maybe my complaint about the price is just my thrifty side. But too me this would be an easier sell at $150 regular price and $50 per jar. Still pricey to me, but more reasonable. I still bought it and am very happy with it, so I guess they are fine with their price point...+ Great blender.= Basic Jar.- Expensive",0
5,love this blender,26-Jul-17,No,"This blender is a beast! It blends up frozen fruits and ice like they are nothing! This is the best blender I have ever bought. It comes with an 8 year warranty!! To clean it, I just put a little hot water, and a squirt of soap inside. I hit the pulse button for 5 seconds and it's clean. I love how easy it is to clean. I'm glad I don't have to try to wash around the blades with a dishcloth. I got this on Prime Day at a great price. I highly recommend this blender for anyone wanting a blender that blends great. Other blenders I've had leave little pieces of ice in my drinks, this one does not do that! It's well worth the money. Blendtec customer service is great to work with as well! I couldn't get my lid to go down all of the way, and the next day they sent me a replacement lid. Blendtec is my new go to blender brand! I'll continue to buy this brand.",1
2,Cumbersome speed control - I would not recommend this to a friend.,27-Sep-17,No,"Meh, it's okay.  There is no doubt that it has tons of power but that's about all.  It's like a bulldozer as opposed to a Ferrari..The speed controls are cumbersome - you have to hit the ""+"" (faster) button to start blending then hit the ""-"" button to slow down the speed.  If it was last used in the high speed (10) watch out because it will start up going light speed before you can turn it down.  The lid doesn't seal all that well so you'll have a mess immediately.  It would be better if it started out on Low speed.  (On my old Waring I could just hit the speed that I wanted by choosing the appropriate button.).The other control buttons on my model are mysterious icons for ""smoothie"", ""ice cream"", ""soup"", ""batter"", etc.  (The blender shown in the instruction manual actually has words on the buttons.)  The only thing that I can figure out is that they can sell this model across different language barriers - to teens who just want to hit the button and make smoothies.  I'd rather have a better control system for speeds and duration (I really don't need duration - I can turn it off myself) than preset programs.  I guess the presets looked good to the marketing department..I would not recommend this model to a friend.",0
3,Power,7-Jan-13,Yes,I have just purchased a Blendtec Blender from Amazon and received an American plug outlet..I now have to purchase a converter and plug adaptor! Was really looking forward to using straight away.,2
4,Great product with surprising issues,11-Jan-16,No,"I bought the Blendtec three months ago. It makes fantastic smoothies. However, I also bought the ""twister jar"" expecting that it would also make great sauces and dips...To my dismay, if I try to blend something like cranberries and apples, it doesn't blend them without an excessive amount of water. If I want fully smooth cranberry sauce, I have to use my food processor first, and then put it into the twister jar to finish it. That is really inefficient, so I'd rather just use my food processor and let it little bits of apple skin not be perfectly pureed...When making thick dips, even worse things happen with the twister jar. Not only will it not blend fully without quite a bit of fluid, I've had the entire twister jar come flying off the machine while it was running, splattering me and my entire kitchen with sauce. Not just once, but three times! I'm sticking to my food processor for sauces...It will do a nice cashew cheese with soaked cashews, lemon juice and such in the twister jar. It'll blend 2 cups of dry sunflower seeds into powder in less than a minute. It will also do chia seeds and flax seeds which a food processor will not do, and a regular blender will not do...The smoothie carafe does great with frozen berries, greens and milks. It gets the drink entirely smooth without excess heating, with less noise than most blenders (perhaps any blender I've ever heard, actually), and very quickly. It even decimates chard stems into a smoothie without any lumps...A note about the lid: I love how easy the lid is to clean. However, because it is so smooth and sleek looking, it seems to not seal as firmly in place as many blender lids. Or maybe it is because it is square. Whatever the reason, a chunk of frozen fruit flying at it can dislodge the lid if you're not careful. I've had it happen a few times. Seems wisest to hold the machine for the first 7 to 10 seconds before wandering away...Overall, I'm happy with the machine, but expected it would have more capabilities than it actually does...~ Raederle.The Consciousness Alchemist",1
5,Over 2000 blends &amp; still going strong w/ no problems,25-Dec-13,No,"08.21.15 Update - just did my 2000th blend with this amazing blender. Customer service is excellent - my bowl started leaking and they sent me a new one for free, no questions asked!..I owned an Orange Julius franchise for 20 years so I know about blenders. We have used our Blendtec 1-3 times/day since we bought it, mostly making smoothies. It's a beast - loud yes, but makes a perfect smoothie every time. I was sure when I bought it that I would be taking advantage of their good warranty, but after over 1500 uses, it still works perfectly. At the rate we are using it, it will have over 5.000 blends before the warranty expires!.I wish there was a glass bowl option as the polycarbonate bowl does get scratched up.",25
1,"NOT: Will it blend, BUT: will it last? Will it blast your family/neighbors out of bed in the mornig",10-Oct-15,No,"NOT: Will it blend, BUT: will it last? Yep. Just 9 months later it's worn out. This is actually the shortest life blender I've ever had. The other question to ask: is the volume of sound/performance ratio make this product worth buying? NO!!. It is SO loud, it will blast your family members and neighbors out of their beds in the morning. I'm not kidding!  And it doesn't really blend better than my old blenders. Buy this if you live alone and don't live in a condo and like to talk ""power"" tools.  And finally, that question BlendTec likes to ask: Will it blend? It depends. If it's electronics, apparently it does. But here's the thing: I'm a human. I don't drink electronics. I drink smoothies with fruit in them and many of the fruits don't blend very well, esp. the peaches and fresh coconut. You have to blend for a long time and by then, you do have a blended smoothie, but a very hot one, too. Yuck. Save your money. Buy a cuisnart or nutribullet. You'll save a ton, it will last longer, the sound won't blast your family/neighbors out of bed, and it will actually blend and make a nice cold smoothie.",7
3,Good blender but price is not warrented,6-Nov-07,Yes,"I'm a smoothie guy, at least 4 times a week I make a OJ, yogurt, frozen berries, and banana smoothie. I've used a Hamilton Beach Bar blender for the past ten years and it did a great job. Once in awhile I had to reblend the smoothie to get a frozen strawberry completely blended but other than that, it did the job...So, when the Hamilton Beach finally died, I wanted to get a more powerful blender to really make a smooth smoothie. Did my research and saw reviews on the Blendtec that almost brought tears to my eyes so I decided that was the one for me, in spite of the $400 price, if it made great smoothies, it was worth it...Well, after having the Blendtec for over a month and making 25 smoothies (the blendtec keeps track of how many times you use it) I have to say, I was disappointed. It is indeed a powerful blender, and it does have a preprogrammed smoothie button, but I still get the occasional strawberry that was not pulverized so now as a rule, after the preprogrammed cycle, I do a ten second pulse blend and that seems to make the perfect smoothie...The Blendtec is a good blender but not 4X as good as the Hamilton Beach Bar blender. I'm not going to use it for Soups, or as a wheat mill, so I may not be the right audience. If I had the whole thing to do over again, I'd buy another Hamilton Beach blender or one of the ones in that class. For $400 I was expecting amazing and that's not what I got, what I got was a good blender for $400, and there are good blenders out there for much less...UPDATE! 960 smoothies and five years later the Blendtec is going strong. No sign of fatigue and other than the inside of the jar being scratched, it looks as good as new. I suspect unless they used glass any blending jar will eventually become scratched from things like the seeds in the fruit. Still a good blender and I see the price has gone down slightly which is always good...One surprise after my origional review was the number of passionite comments that followed. There is ""the bigger is better"" camp of Blendtec and Vitamix and the more practical camp of people who are looking for value. I understand both sides and as an owner of the Blendtec will certainly not discourge either direction. Both are going to get you a smoothie...And just because this has shown to be an issue of interest, I checked and yes, Hamilton Beach still makes a commercial blender that sells for less than $100 (model 908) but they too have seen the light and like Blendtec and Vitamix, are now selling a high end 3hp blender (HBH650) with lots of features and a $500 price tag to match. So, now you guys have three high end blenders to compare, and discuss, I for one would love to hear from the person who buys the high end Hamilton Beach blender. It looks like a serious piece of equipment, not that I need a serious piece of equipment, just curious how great it can be?",331
5,Good quality blender. Worth the price.,7-Oct-18,No,"I love, love, love this blender. I scored this on prime day, cashed in some credit card points and waited patiently. I use this blender primarily for smoothies and baby food..I find it can handle most of what I put in it. Sometimes the consistency isn?€?t what I desire- for instance, blueberries don?€?t get super smooth- the peel is still a tad chunky. Same with kale..Every now and again what I?€?m pureeing seems to jam up the blade and that?€?s my cue to add a bit of water or liquid..I don?€?t find this to be totally loud. It?€?s no different than any other blender and not much louder than my kitchen mixer..Overall, I love the electronic screen and the touch buttons that take the guess work out of how long I should leave it going on what setting. I leave it on my kitchen counter because I don?€?t feel like taking it out every day. It doesn?€?t take up too much space.",0
5,This blender is amazing!,24-Nov-17,No,"This blender is amazing. I?€?ve had other blenders before including the ninja and the Blendtec is no comparison. When I would make green smoothies with the other blenders, there would always be bits of green that didn?€?t get blended in. Now with the Blendtec, it does such a good job blending thay it completely pulverizes anything I put in that smoothie! I use this blender multiple times a day?€?I can make flour out of rolled oats, make creamy sauces out of cashews and other ingredients and make yummy and healthy smoothies for the family. I love that it fits on my counter and its easy to clean too!",1
5,"Easy to rinse clean, light weight",27-Jul-17,No,Very easy for preparing juice and smoothy. The best thing is it's so easy to just rinse it clean right after use which makes all other juicers and blenders obsolete in our kitchen. When cleaning after each use is time-consuming and troublesome in some machines we don't make juice any more. With this Blendtec my wife makes fruit juice with berries and yogurt every morning and still have time to sit down and enjoy breakfast. The whole machine construction is light weight and yet feels solid to be easily moved around which adds to its convenience.,1
5,Perfect Blender,8-May-14,No,"I've never used a Vitamix, so I don't have ultimate authority to write a review. I'm coming to this blender from many previous ""normal"" blenders ($20-$50 at any local store). And compared to those, this thing is amazing (as it should be, I suppose, for the price). I've heard some people complain about the noise, but it just sounds like any other blender to me. And yes, it does bounce around a bit when you start it if you have solid ingredients in it, but you just have to hold it down for a few seconds while it's at low speed, then it will ramp up and you can wander off if you like. I can't imagine another blender producing better results, just because that doesn't seem possible. Everything you put in it is liquified. I'm so used to my old blenders that at first I kept putting in way too much liquid. I used to have to fill the canister to very close to the level of solid ingredients with liquid if I didn't want it to completely clog itself up, but now I'm not sure I need any liquid at all with most of my smoothies. And I've never needed a tamper. So far it just turns everything into a little tornado...So, my point is: if you're deciding between this and a Vitamix that costs a couple hundred more, just save the money and go with this one (at Costco, if you really want a good deal). Especially if you're just looking to upgrade from an old Target blender; you're going to be blown away. I love dropping un-cored apples and un-cored pineapple into my smoothies. Or maybe an orange with just most of the peel hacked off. Then add some raw oats to make it more filling and some spinach just because I can. And the jar is a great size. Before I got it I was worried it would be too big to make single-serve smoothies, but it's not a problem at all to fill it up a quarter of the way. This thing don't care. It's the honey badger of blenders.",2
3,"Makes great smoothies, but there's leakage",22-Nov-18,No,"I got the blendtec on prime day and couldn't wait to make my first smoothie since that was the primary reason i shelled out for a great blender.  This blendtec comes with a built in counter  so I know I hit a 100 uses today, with almost half the count being due to taking advantage of the easy clean-up process. So, at about 55 smoothies in, I have to say the quality of the blend is pretty amazing; no grittiness in my smoothies from kale or any of the other power greens. At times i find pea size bits of fruit still left; however, i completely excuse this because i use hard frozen fruit to make my smoothies. I don't even mind too much that after a bit over 50 smoothies, the plastic jar seems to have developed a haze near the base; plastic always seems to do that...What I can't really excuse is the leakage. t started about 15 smoothies ago and, at first, i simply thought i must have spilled. But since i've been faced with a bit of green liquid at the bottom of my jar and around the motor after almost every use since, i can say with confidence that it leaks. I had the thought that maybe this was an inferior model specifically made for amazon, but even at the discounted price tag of  $200 (so really, it's suppose to be a $300 product), i feel like leakage shouldn't happen. I'll be contacting blentec immediately since this should still be covered by warranty and see what they say. Updates to come.",3
2,Update: I now own a Vitamix.,8-Feb-14,No,"Update: Feb 2015:..I now own a Vitamix. I was in love with the Blendtec when I first got it. I even bought the twister jar. I felt like I could make everything with this blender, but after a while the seals on my jars started to leak and the motor started to slow down. I took it back to Costco and got a new one, and after a few months had the same problem...After taking it back to Costco a second time, I noticed that they changed the design and, at least in my opinion, the quality of the old Total Blender classic...Maybe I'm wrong about the quality of the new Blendtec, but I had to take it back a third time just a few weeks ago: the motor completely died on me. Wouldn't even turn on, and this after only 100 cycles of mostly smoothies and green drinks. I don't think I even made nut butter with the twister jar once on this new blender... So, after getting tired of having to return the Blendtec and deciding the new quality, at least seems, to have been lowered, I wentwith the Vitamix...I still love the Blendtec, so I hope that I just got 3 lemons and that the rest of you are still enjoying your blenders...Old review:..This is an awesome blender. Between this and the Vitamix, I chose the Blendtec because I didn't have to buy a separate jar for dry foods, though I am planning on buying a twister jar for nutbutters. Really, though, either one is great. I love the fact that I can put a whole orange, some almond milk, a brussel sprout, a handful of kale and spinach, some flax seed, and maybe some honey or half a banana, and get a drink that fills up me, gives me energy, and helps me lose weight...However, I don't recommend putting an entire lime in--peel those babies first. Today I blended kale, spinach, an orange, flax, protein powder, almond milk, water, yogurt, and a lime. The entire lime . . . not good. I guess you could say I'm still trying to figure out this whole foods thing.",4
5,amazing customer service,2-Jan-15,No,"So I ordered a Blendtec as a New Years surprise gift for my wife. I thought I would go cheap and get the 4 sided jar instead of the wildside but after I placed my order and did some more research I changed my mind and gave them a call... Miss J was so nice and helpful, to make a long story short because of the 20$ amazon gift card I was getting through blendit.tv by using their portal they couldn't change the order without canceling it... so they decided to eat the difference and upgrade me for free... wow.. they even called me back to make sure everything was good. After dealing rude customer service people from third world nations on a regular basis, this was a nice change of pace.. and now the warranty is either 7 or 8 years depending on the model!",3
5,Great Customer Service When You Need it!,18-Apr-16,No,"We bought a BlendTec from a ""box store"" 3 years ago. A few weeks ago the jar started to leak and the motor was making funny noises when running. I felt terrible that I had not registered for the warranty and was thinking we were stuck. We loved this blender and were using it almost every day for smoothies. I went on the BlendTec website and was afraid they would ask for proof of purchase. To my surprise, they asked only for the blender serial number and the jar number. I located both numbers quickly and submitted the form. Less than 24 hours later we received a response that a brand new jar had been ordered. We just received it in less than a week later since it is made in the USA. We are so happy that BlendTec honored its 8 year warranty so fast. FREE of ANY CHARGE. This company really exceeded my expectations for customer service. They provided some tips on handling the blender that we had overlooked: (1) Fill in the liquids first, then from softer to harder food types. (2)Do not store foods in the jar overnight. Do not wash in the washer (at least NOT dry HEATING). (3) If the blender has not been used for a while, manually turn the jar's metal shaft for 10 seconds to lubricate.",3
5,You will not find a better blender.,18-Oct-13,No,"I had always heard talk about the Vitamix then I met a few people that had one and raved about it.  How it makes the best smoothies....blah blah blah.  I researched it and there are some cons that I didn't want with that one and the research led to me to it's rival: The Blendtec Total.  The Blendtec seemed to solve all the drawbacks to the Vitamix.  But it was pricey ($500) when I bought it but I did it...and I've never looked back. That was four years ago and I bought it specifically for smoothies.  There is nothing I can throw in this thing that it won't pulverize effortlessly.  But it does more than that...Pros:.Crushes ice.Makes the smoothest smoothies on the planet.Great butter maker.Powerful.Easy to clean, large Wild Side jar.Programmed settings..Cons: (yes is one).LOUD..This this is really loud. It doesn't bother me in the least because it's so powerful you're not blending or using it for more than 3 minutes total..If you're thinking about getting a high powered blender, forget the Vitamix and go with this one. You won't be sorry.",3
3,SO LOUD,18-Mar-15,No,"We use our Blendtech on average once a day.  It does a great job making frozen fruit into smoothies, and you can even use things like blueberries that usually leave those little unappetizing skin bits - the blendtech blends everything nice and smooth.  It also seems to be holding up quite well to such frequent use, although we've only had it about 9 months so it's a little early to tell.  The big downside, and for me it is a really big one, is that the thing is horribly, conversation-stoppingly, hearing-damagingly LOUD.  You actually cannot have a conversation while the blendtech is going.  I personally can't do anything much while it is on because it drives me out of the kitchen.  I'm planning to buy those headsets the guys on the airport tarmac use, to protect all our hearing while the Blendtech is in use.  Or I'm thinking about building it its own shed in the back yard.  Anyway, the point is, great blender, but really, REALLY loud.",1
5,""" But 13 years later it's still working and it is hands down the best blender we've ever owned",6-Jul-16,No,"I bought a Blendtec Blender 13 years ago, and paid almost 300 bucks for it at Costco.  When I got home, I said to myself, ""What the heck were you thinking, spending that much money for a blender?""  But 13 years later it's still working and it is hands down the best blender we've ever owned.  It crushes and mixes and blends everything but rocks.  And it's sooo easy to clean.  You don't have to take the blades out ...there's not flimsy little rubber gasket to have to clean or remove ...it's great.  Buy one.",2
5,Love this blender!,11-Feb-14,No,"This blender was referred to me at the time by a coworker and it definitely doesn't disappoint! To be honest I didn't do much of the Vitamix vs Blendtec research out there. However I did do more research on it after getting this blender. The appeal this blender has over the Vitamix to me, is the size and being able to keep it on the counter and under the cabinets where the Vitamix wouldn't fit and I also like having the presets that the Blendtec provides. My wife and I use this for everything! We love making hummus in this along with our own salsa. We've made countless smoothies and juices (although the juices are very pulpy if you like that sort of thing), soups, pancake and waffle batters, and baby food. I've even used it to make my own laundry soap. This blender has so many uses! It's got a ton of power and it's so easy to clean unlike most blenders. I like that the blades aren't sharp so I don't have to worry about cutting myself. And cleaning is as easy as putting a cup of water and a drop of dish soap and pulsing it. Cleans it very well! At the end of the day I could see myself using either the Blendtec or Vitamix as they are both high powered blenders. However with the features that I've included I'm very happy with this purchase!",2
1,UPDATE:  Jar Design Flaw? Rubber dust &amp; bits in smoothies?,21-Aug-11,No,"Here's a video comparison review of the BlendTec vs models across 2 other price ranges from you tube:..watch?v=SYGwhX8JlzU..The BlendTec uses metal couplings for both the base and the jar. It uses a 2 blade design that's dull on one side and slightly sharp on the other. Its sharpness is somewhere between a paring knife and a butter knife. It uses a polycarbonate jar, the same jar used at Jamba Juice and Starbuck's. Starbuck's uses this same model. The jar and blade assembly is a sealed design that cannot be taken apart for cleaning. So, you just use warm water and a drop of dishwasher soap for cleaning...UPDATE:..I tried making peanut butter with my brand new BlendTec and everything was going great, so I thought.  When I finished blending the peanut, I opened the jar to scoop it out.  Then, I noticed black bits my nut butter.  I wondered if it was burnt peanuts because the process does get kind of hot.  After closer inspection, I realized that those black bits were pieces of the rubber o-ring!  I ended up having to throw away all the beautiful nut butter I'd just made. When I examined the jar, I could see the rubber o-ring under the blade, slipped up and out of position. This made me realize a MAJOR FLAW with the jar design. It has metal parts in frictional contact with rubber o-rings. When the blade spins lightning fast, this introduces the very real possibility of the metal creating microscopic rubber ""dust"" and/or bits from grinding of the metal axle of the blade with the black rubber o-rings that are supposed to keep the jar from leaking.",86
3,Good motor but should have plunger.,7-Sep-18,No,"It is a solid blender, but if I had it to buy all over again, I would have got the Vitamix because of the plunger.  We bought a Nutribullet to make the smoothies. Because it is so efficient and you can drink out the cups, we only bring out the Blentech twice a month.  If you get this at the deal of the day price though, it is a better deal than vitamix if you can live without the plunger.  If you need an industrial strength blender, this seems good enough.  If you are getting just to make single smoothies, get a Nutribullet.",1
5,"Awesome blender, if a bit loud...",26-Sep-11,No,"To echo the other reviewers, this blender is a bit on the loud side... but thankfully it never goes for too long, so you can handle it.  It's absolutely amazing how well this blender works.  Seriously. I kid you not. Soup in 90 seconds. Ice cream in like 2 minutes. Unbelievable. Frozen adult beverages, smoothies, whole juices, dips, etc... If you can think it up, you can blend it up. I'm actually getting my servings of fruits and veggies in a day because I can blend it all up in the Blendtec in under a minute. Forget chopping. Even carrots and potatoes... Peel 'em, cut in half (or quarter) and toss them in with a little water/chicken/veggie broth... salt/pepper to taste, hit the soup button... zzzzzzziiiip... soup's on!!..It's crazy how well this machine works. AND let's not forget how easy to clean!! Holy cannoli. I used to spend like half an hour trying to clean out my sweet potato puree from my old blender. No more, my friends. Blend it up, dump it out, little soap, little water, pulse 3 times (or just rinse it out the old fashioned way) and done...The worst part is the sound. But that's what you get when you have a super huge 10 speed motor in your blender. I also understand now, why the Starbucks all had those plastic things around their blenders... wasn't to block mess, it was to block sound. But for healthier living, I can deal with a little loudness. I don't think I've ever been this much of a brand evangelist before, but I am for Blendtec. Love it.",5
5,customer service is amazing,13-Jun-14,No,"The blender is fantastic, but what is even better is their customer service. The blender motor comes with a three year warranty and the blender jar with a seven year warranty, but the seal on the bottom of my blender jar started leaking after about 800 blends and one year into owning the blender. I almost didn't call customer service because I anticipated that they would try to blame the leak on me in some way. I started looking on Amazon and thought I would just buy a new jar --- but I decided to call Blendtec Customer Service before ordering. . .  just in case my jar was covered. The person at Blendtec was very friendly, immediately apologized for the problem and said ""we'll send you a new jar!"" . . .  that's it! No accusations, no nothing. I am still in shock.  it was so easy ---- that was the best customer service I have ever had... Blendtec really backs their product. I love the blender but I am even happier now!",2
5,The Terminator of blenders,3-Dec-13,No,"If you find yourself considering the Blendtec here, you've probably already seen it in action (and were impressed) or already compared it to a Vitamix, or you might have been hooked on their Youtube series of ""Will it Blend"" (the answer is always yes)...Yes, it will in almost 99% of cases pulverize whatever you put in it. Blendtec blenders are like the Porsche 911 of blenderdom; refined from generation to generation and focussed on the same core tasks over and over. That refinement shows in all the details; the unit is very easy to clean with almost no crevices for food to get stuck in, the angular shape of the jars creates natural spouts while still sealing when in use, there are drain/air holes on the bottom of the jars, the jar connector is made from durable steel, superstrong blades that are dull and you won't cut yourself on them, etc. The list goes on and on. Everything is geared to make the blending experience pleasurable. This is what happens when a company obsesses over an appliance and is what ""justifies"" the ~10x cost vs. your garden variety wally mart special. It belongs at the top of the pyramid but if the cost is prohibitive, there are ninja models that supposedly come close in power but I'm not sure they would also have the same durability...Oh and of course the power! This thing literally sounds like a small motorcycle inside your kitchen, it's not for the faint of heart. While it claims to be able to replace a number of other appliances, some of those are a stretch in my opinion. We use ours to mainly make fresh almond milk, frozen fruit smoothies, and flour milling. After soaking almonds overnight, we can make fresh almond milk with pulp in less than two minutes, the pre-programmed buttons makes great smoothies, but we did have to buy the round jar to get optimal flour results...The main difference vs. a Vitamix appears to be the stamper on the Vitamix which can help improve blend results since you can manually correct mixing etc. The blendtec relies more on varying the speed of the blades to jolt and shock the contents into the right slurry movement to optimize the blend; this does require you stick pretty close to their recommended recipe and stacking of ingredients (ice first, etc.)...If you plan to blend often and expect your products to be top of class and last, this is one to consider.",0
5,"Awesome Blender: Power, Performance, and Durability.",28-Jan-08,No,"Bought mine over 18 months ago and waited before writing up a review.  In that period, I've used this blender daily, sometimes multiple times per day.  It has held up under this constant, heavy use -- no problems with parts or performance at all.  It performs as well today as when I bought it, unlike previous blenders I've owned that rely on sharpness of their blades...I got this blender to improve my diet by adding more whole fruit and vegetable smoothies.  This device supplements my juicing by allowing me to blend whole fruits and retain one of the most beneficial part of the fruit (the fiber)...This Blender is extremely powerful and does a great job creating consistent, smooth drinks from whole fruits.  Yes it's VERY loud, but when I got my blood pressure and cholesterol tests back and every time I weigh myself, I consider the roar of this machine music to my ears!..Despite what some reviewers claim, this blender does NOT need a tamper.  I've never felt the need for one, and as I mentioned I blend whole fruits and make thick shakes.  The Blendtec is designed to oscillate or pulse rather than maintain a constant speed as other blenders do.  This prevents a vacuum from being created and allows inputs to settle into the blade.  On occassion when I have been too lazy to cut my fruit into smaller pieces and found some chunks, a second cycle or use of the ""pulse"" function is all it took to make a perfect shake...As another reviewer mentioned, this blender is great for entertaining -- both as a functional appliance and as a conversation piece.",54
2,Count on replacing the jar once a year,28-Nov-16,No,"Works great but the seal design on the jar continues to frustrate me to no end and at $100/jar is way overpriced. First you will notice a buildup inside the seal chamber, then the blade will start to wobble and finally pieces of the seal will start breaking off on the bottom...If you use it enough to get your money out of it count yourself in for replacing the jar at least once a year @ ~$100",3
1,"Wanted to love it.  After 3 failed units, no more.",5-Jan-17,No,"So... I want to love the Blendtec... I really do.  After doing tons of research, I chose it over everything else.  So decisively, in fact, that nothing else seems worth buying now...I bought my first Blendtec (one of the models with the touch-screen panel), brought it home, plugged it in, and ""ERR"" showed up on the screen.  Called customer service, they were closed.  Brought it back (had bought it at a local large electronics retail store), got a different one.  Got the second one home, plugged it in, and all of the ""buttons"" were lit up.  when I'd touch one, the light went out, but nothing happened.  I continued to touch each ""button"" until all the lights were off.  THEN THE MOTOR SUDDENLY STARTED UP!  Yanked the cord out of the wall...  Plugged it back in, repeated the exact same process, recorded it on my phone before returning it...Then, I bought this simpler model at a local club store, hoping I wouldn't have the same interface failures.  Worked awesome for the first 25 blends... Thought I had a winner!  Tonight, went to blend some frozen berries and milk.  Turned it on, a couple berries jumped, then nothing.  Thought it was jammed.  So, I stopped it, removed the jar, shook it up to move things around, put it back on the base, turned it back on... Nothing.  Finally gave up, dumped everything out, and noticed that the blade was turning independently of the drive shaft... they had become separated.  I wonder how many cell phones they blended with this thing before I got it.....I thought hard about exchanging it for yet another one... but I'm spending $300+ for a BLENDER!  I should not have had to replace it 3 times.  So, I no longer felt it wise to invest my hard-earned money on something that I can't trust.  I guess I may be going to the Vitamix next.",1
3,Blend Tec vs. Vita-Mix,14-Feb-12,No,"I bought the Blend Tec based on the positive reviews, ratings in some magazines, and advertisements.  It is a good blender overall, and the preprogrammed settings are convenient; but it has one significant problem and a couple frustrations.  I most often used it to make smoothies.  I liked it until I used fresh fruit that had larger seeds like raspberries and, in particular, blackberries.  When I made a smoothie using fresh, whole blackberries and tried to drink it, the seeds were cracked but in large and sharp pieces that actually scratched my throat as I swallowed.  So I put the smoothie through a second cycle, and then even a third cycle, which made a slight but not that much of a difference.  On subsequent occasions I got the same results.  Frustrations: it is the LOUDEST blender out there; I didn't like the way the lid fit and was more difficult to get on and off than others; it's subjective, but I wasn't wild about the ""rocket ship"" styling.  It may be able to ""blend"" golf balls and broom handles like in the advertisements, but if it can't blend raspberries and blackberries smooth, it has a major problem.  And given its high price, this makes it even more of a problem..So, very disappointed, I decided to try and bought a Vita-Mix.  The Vita-Mix really makes smooth smoothies and pulverizes seeds including the dreaded fresh blackberry seeds; even the small seeds in strawberries are blended smooth.  It also is quieter, I think the lid is easier to put on and take off, and though not great I like the styling somewhat better.  Vita-Mix also has a new ""professional"" model now that has both some preprogrammed settings as well as the usual continuously variable control.  For those who have commented/complained about how tall it is, Vita-Mix also has a smaller 32 oz. container, which easily fits under my kitchen cabinets and which I use most of the time instead of the standard 68 oz. container.  Also, the Vita-Mix is consistently rated #1 in Consumer Reports tests.  Further, I have often seen Vita-Mix blenders on cooking shows on the Food Channel and used commercially in smoothie and ice cream shops; I've never seen a Blend Tec in either.  The Vita-Mix is not perfect, but at this time it is the best all around blender out there.",40
5,Little powerhouse,29-Oct-18,No,"I've been wanting to buy this for a long time and it was well worth it. I did not want to buy a juicer and a blender and after much research I decided on this one. I use it to ""chop"" up celery and stain it through a nut milk bag to make celery juice and it handles smoothies great. *Note to other buyers, please read the instructions about how to layer things properly so it doesn't get stuck.",0
5,Wowee - Fabulous Blender,6-Jul-09,No,"I did a ton of research and in the end I went by the recommendation from the Green Smoothie Girl??. Ever been to Jamba Juice? See those blenders? This blender looks just like theirs - it is a workhorse...Clean up is really quick and easy. I read a lot of reviews and I am very happy with this blender...The one bit of advice I'd like to offer new juicing folks is know that some of the greens are packed full of GREEN/GRASS flavor. Be careful not to add too much green and not enough of another color (fruit/veggies) - one of my first Green Smoothy tests - I tasted ""GRASS"" for days after ....blech!",38
2,No good!,24-Feb-14,No,"I have this blender for not even two years now. I wash it by hand and never use dish washer for cleaning the jar. This unit was working fine for the first year and after that the jar started leaking. I called the Blendtec and was able to get the new one with no problem. After two months the unit itself stop working. Just died one day. Maybe for occasional use this blender will work but I use it almost every day. I don't use it even with ice. So anyway it is not working now and when I called the company and explained the situation they offered me to get the new one for $185.00. They declined to cover the warranty because I took the unit outside of the USA. They said they believe the unit is not working because it got affected by using in it in the different country. Really??? 110 Watts in St. Maarten is different from the one in USA? Then why all my other things are working here with no malfunction? I am very disappointed with this blender and I don't believe it is worth so much money. In addition, it is very noisy machine. My mother and my sister are Vitamix owners and their units are more quiet then this. My suggestion is to give business to someone else because if you are planing to use Blendtec regularly it will break after a year or two. Also, if you are located outside of USA and have issues with the machine don't tell customer representative the truth about your location otherwise they will use it against you. Just lie and it will help you to save a lot of money and headache because my $400 are going straight to the garbage. I am not giving this unreliable company additional $185.",4
1,"Buyer Beware, Doesn't Last",27-Mar-14,No,"It was a good blender for a while, but broke in a year and a half and only about 100 cycles.  I waited in the waiting queue with their returns department for 15 minutes.  After I told the rep that my motor had been smoking and dripping oil, she insisted that the problem was the jar and not the motor, and that she could do nothing for me unless I was in front of the machine troubleshooting with her.  Their customer service hours are limited M-F until 530pm Mountain Time, so I'll have to take time from work to troubleshoot my $400 blender.  Awesome.",18
5,Excellent Results - great product,19-May-12,No,"We bought a Breville BJE510XL Ikon 900-Watt Variable-Speed Juice Extractor some years ago and had been using it with good results. The Breville is still working great with no problems since we first bought it in 2009..However we hardly ever use the Breville now since bought the Blend-tech blender in 2010 and now blend fruit and veggies every morning for a healthy smoothie. I guess it's a philosophical thing, but it always seemed a pity to be dumping all the pulp out in the trash from the juicer and one couldn't help but wonder if we were losing some of the minerals or goodness...Last year we bought the wider Wild Side Jar (square design with the fifth side) from the Blend-tech website and that has improved the ease of blending even more...We are at blend count number 1061 - Not bad after approximately 2 years. That means we are doing an average of 1.5 blends per day...It's not often you can buy a gadget for the kitchen that gets such heavy usage...I bought this from COSTCO since they force BlenTec to give an extended warranty..What a great health giving buy...Try to buy this with the wider fifth side jar if you can...",1
2,I like the Vita-Mix better,20-Jun-12,No,"I returned by Blendtec after 6 weeks of use for a Vita-Mix. The Blendtec just would not blend the frozen fruit to make my smoothies smooth. There would always be little round balls of icy fruit that would get stuck at the end of the straw. I was also not happy with the ""free spinning"" of the blade when there is too much frozen fruit and not enough liquid when making sorbet or ice cream. If I added more liquid it would blend, but then the frozen dessert would be too liquid-y. I've had the Vita-Mix for just a week, but I like the tamper which keeps the icy fruit moving when making a frozen dessert. The Blendtec also has a 1-quart jar, while the Vita-Mix has a 2-quart jar, and although it doesn't fit under the cabinet, there's nothing wrong with keeping the jar next to the base. Mine is used so often that it's more likely to be draining on the dish drainer. The larger jar means that liquid won't splash out of the top, which happened even when the lid was on the Blendtec. I haven't had the Vita-Mix long enough to find problems with it, but I already know that it's a better blender.",11
4,Great Blender - Questionable Caraffe,10-Oct-13,No,"I did dozens of hours of Blender research three and a half years ago.  I wanted the best, and we deciding between Vitamix and Blendtec like most people who are probably reading this review.  Overall, I think I would probably go with the Blendtec again.  If you want to make nut butters I would suggest a Vitamix.  This machine cannot be used with a tamper, and without it, despite the advertisement you cannot get good nut butter...This thing makes great green smoothies, which was precisely why I wanted it.  I love the 1 touch user friendly approach.  I've rarely had an even partial frozen strawberry after 3 years of daily use.  I used it to grind flax seed before I make the smoothie and it does a fantastic job...The Carafe started giving me problems at about 2 years of use.  I started getting black oiling substances on the bottom half of the carafe where it meets the motor base.  It was strange because I would wash and completely dry the carafe after each use.  Right at 2 years, I was blending and all hell broke loose.  Black plastic seals from the bottom of the base broke free and there was smoothie everywhere.  Like an idiot, I waited until after the 3 year warranty because I thought it had 7 years.  They told me I was out of warranty but they were nice enough to send me a open box carafe that had never been used...I gave this blender 4 stars because I think the carafe design may need rethinking.  I know people who have had Vitamixes for 15 years with the same carafe, but I'm not sure if they used it the 500x + times that I did in 2 years.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the product and quality of motor design and overall fit and feel.  With a 7 year warranty that is now offered, you may go through a couple of carafes if you are a power user.  Or I may have just gotten a defective one.  Either way, Blendtec Customer service was nice and helped me out even though they didn't have to.  Good luck in your decision and happy blending!",5
2,Buy a cheaper blender and blend your remaining cash with it instead,11-Nov-18,No,"I bought this elsewhere, but this is my go-to place to read reviews so here I am. I used this blender to make smoothies for a little over a week. I added my ingredients according to the proper stacking guidelines. This blender took a solid 10 minutes to make a smoothie. I tried pulsing to get it going, I tried to use just the smoothie setting, I tried manually adjusting speeds. It kept making air pockets and the blender essentially stopped blending every 3 seconds. I had to stand at the blender with it on the lowest speed and stir with the spatula to keep it from stopping. A blender of this price should be push button and come back to a perfect smoothie. My Vitamix ($30 more) is on the way.",2
5,Fantastic Power,7-Jun-11,No,"We didn't know whether we wanted the Vitamix or the Blendtec, but after seeing the demo at Costco, we decided on Blendtec. I think it's expensive for a blender, but I had two that didn't really do a very good job. This makes great smoothies, dips and soups. I did an experiment with my cheap Hamilton Beach vs. the Blendtec. I put a 4-inch piece of celery and a cup of water in each blender and powered up. The Blendtec made celery water - there wasn't so much as a string in sight. No remnant of the celery - just green water. The Hamilton Beach whirled the celery minimally and left the celery almost totally intact...The seal does fit tightly, I have used my Blendtec almost 100 times and have NEVER had the lid come off; just press it down as designed...It's a cinch to clean and only three parts to wash: the seal, the plastic part that goes inside of it, and the carafe...Well worth the price. We paid about $425 at Costco, including tax. We also have a recipe book that came with it...If you make lots of smoothies, dips, soups and icy beverages - you will love this!",2
5,Blender for Life,3-Sep-16,No,"I bought my blendtech from Costco about four years ago.  I have used it almost every day.  Over 1,000+ blends, smoothie and while juice settings among others. The seals and gaskets are in perfect working condition.  I've never had a single negative experience or issue with the blender.  I'm not certain about the other reviews that say the seals go in 2 years.  If you simply want to buy a blender for life, perhaps one you can pass down to your grandchildren, then I recommend the Blendtech.  All other debates and discussions are moot.  Only potential issue is sound, though that's an issue with any high power blender.  Still, that's only an issue for about 30 seconds.  No tamping, stirring, or worrying.  Just push the button (ice cream, smoothie, soup, juice, etc) come back in a minute, rinse out with warm water for about ten seconds, enjoy your meal.",1
5,Very happy so far,27-Aug-17,No,"I love this thing. I can blend a container full of greens, carrots celery stalks apples at the same time with no problem if I first quarter the apple . It has a very powerful motor that growls not whines.  Fits under our kitchen cabinets which the other high end blender maker may not.",1
5,Happy I bought it! Blendtec definitely quieter than Ninja,14-Jul-17,No,"After burning thru several regular blenders, i tried Ninja. First Ninja lasted 6 years, when it's bearings stripped, replaced it. One an a half years later, the options panel  malfuntioned. One of my sisters recommeded Blendtec before the second Ninja...wish I had listened. But all is well! I bought this one on Prime Day at a big discount. Made my first smoothie just like i always do. And I love the recipe book that came with it..I am very happy",0
5,Blendtec Customer Service,3-Mar-16,No,"Unbelievable customer service! I'm beyond impressed by their timeliness for such a popular product. They hold customer service in high regard and it shows. The blender self lubricates if you use it regularly, however, I moved and didn't use my Blendtec for a month. I was unaware that you should self-spin the blade and add some cooking oil to make sure any sugar particles are removed before beginning a new cycle. Thus, my blender smoked upon its first use. I read about it on their website and added oil, cleaned the base and I thought I had fixed the problem. I let Blendtec know this and they STILL shipped be a new jar. I was amazed. I purchased my Blendtec a year ago from Costco and it's warranty is incredible. Thank you Blendtec customer service. You outdid yourselves! Plus, I LOVE my Blendtec. I researched and dreamed of having one for 8 years and I was always convinced that its blade was superior to Vitamix's and finally, impulsively gifted myself one. I'm so happy that I did!",2
5,Love the product but the warranty and service really makes it worth it.,1-Aug-17,No,"Love the blender and have been using solidly for 3 years. Just experienced an issue where the blades were ""slipping"" (ie not chopping but just spinning) and called Blendtech. Gave them the serial # off the bottom, and in 3 minutes had a new jar coming my way. I had never sent in ""registration"" and i didn't have to jump thru hoops -they are sending a new one and after 3 years w/ zero maintenance this was the first issue. These things are built like tanks and even tanks need occasional maint. And repair:).  More important since everything fails, the service to keep me happy and blending was stellar and that's well worth the cost!.",1
5,"Spend now, save in the long run",26-Jul-18,No,"Great blender. I?€?ve always wanted a Blendtec but never wanted to spend the money. We bought Ninja?€?s instead. In our experience Ninjas don?€?t last that long and are crazy loud. This blendtec has a great warranty and is MUCH quieter than our Ninja. The blending is as good as you would hope. I would recommend you spend the extra money now on a Blendtec, and you?€?ll probably save money in the long run and have a better blender while doing it.",0
1,Gasket Strips Out,4-May-15,No,"I posted a glowing review on this product when I first purchased it last summer.  Now, there are so many reviews, I can't find mine.  But I have to agree with the other reviewer who said Don't believe anyone who hasn't used this item for a while.  I recommend people read the critical reviews before they buy this, as there has been a legitimate design flaw mentioned, and sources given to prove it.  Do some research before you buy.  My jar gasket stripped out after less than a year, and it smelled like rubber burning all the way.  Like others, I also wonder if rubber got in my smoothie.  If you look in the question section, you will see that one buyer says his daughter is allergic to rubber and had a serious reaction when she drank a smoothie from the jar.  Anyway, mine now leaks profusely and is unusable for liquids.  Maybe I can use it to grind oatmeal or something... but I worry about the rubber issue.  I called Blendtec customer service twice and have been on hold, cumulatively, for over an hour, and still could not get through. The first time I called, I had to hang up after 40 minutes because I had to pick my kid up from school.  The second time I held for an hour until their office closed. I wish I had not bought this blender.  Sigh.",7
5,Very Pleased,8-Sep-12,No,"Our family has been KitchenAid purchaser of blenders for years. Their blenders have always broken down and we always purchased more of the same. We decided to upgrade, and my wife absolutely loves the Blendtec HP3A. Compared Vitamax, Omega, and Blendtec. All said, selected Blendtec. She sets the blender to the settings she wants, walks away, and the results are as if she purchased a product / drink from a retail store. She is tough to please, and she can't say enough about the product. Should have purchased years ago. We've owned the product for 2 weeks and hope we'll have the same results for years.  Comes with a great warranty, but hope I'll never have to use. Just read the instructions and play around with the buttons and you'll see all the flexibility. This is more than a turn off and on product, but can be that product too. Commercial grade, you can tell by the manufacturing design. hope this review helps you decide what product to buy.",1
5,Great product,23-Feb-13,Yes,"I thought the Blendtec was amazing, howerver all of the resipeses were too high in sugar grams for my dibetic condition, so i sent it back.",1
5,Wins over Vitamix,27-May-11,No,"I bought a vitamix six months ago at Costco and will be returning it, after using the Blendtec I definitely like it better..When I saw the Blentec demo the fruit and veggies were cut small, so I was unsure if it could handle the big stuff. So I ran it through the paces of recipes I was making in my Vitamix...I tested it with making Bran muffins (using that twig type cereal that needed to be crushed), Green smoothie (banana, Orange.. peeled with pith intact and quartered, whole granny smith apple quartered, 2 cups spinach and about 2 cups ice...hit the juice button, 50 seconds to amazing), Peanut butter (their directions aren't the best, but it worked, equal to vitamix ) and VitaMix recipe Tortilla Soup (Whole tomatoes, whole carrot in it)using soup button...- it was faster than the vitamix.  Faster...hot soup made with warm water in 90 seconds instead of 5-6 minutes....Green Smoothie in 50 seconds rather than 3-4 minutes..- easier to get thick food out of bottom because of blade, and easier to get everything out of container because of smooth sides..- Don't have to worry about sharp blade when cleaning or trying to scrape stuff out of the bottom..- smaller, not so huge on my limited counter space...I did buy the larger container as well..These were enough positives for me to switch...update 7/5/13: Well I've had the Blendtec for several years now, use it all the time. Found out I really enjoy making bread dough in it... fast. Have no problems with leaking seals etc. Still highly recommend.",6
5,How did I live without this?!!,4-Jan-12,No,"I've been a proud owner of a Blendtec Total Blender for over a year and a half now. My husband and I saw a demonstration at Costco and were in awe (especially the ability to make soups!) and then he bought one for me for my birthday several months later...We've used it now nearly 600 times and I just got him the new(er) Wildside jar about a month ago. We use both jars now and it's great for entertaining and/or making different things in each (virgin cocktails and alcoholic, pizza dough and pesto sauce, etc.). I've made soups (warming up the milk or water used first gives you soup more than hot enough), salsa, hummus, cappuccinos, lattes, smoothies, blended drinks, muffin/cake batter, bread/pizza dough, sauces, wet dog food... Even obliterated dehydrated chicken tenders to sprinkle on my dog's food as a treat (a few pulses did the trick!)...Before owning this, I wasn't one to usually bother with a blender since I'd never used one that blended smoothly or cleanly enough. And it's really very quick to clean it up afterwards (sometimes it takes a bit more than usual to be sure nothing is still under the blades, but it's generally minimal). It easily fits under the counter, where it has a permanent home and is used just about once a day for one thing or another...(little hint for anyone who wants to make ice-blended drinks/frappacinos like Starbucks, CB&amp;TL, etc. and wants that thicker consistency: a small pinch of xanthan gum is the secret!)",5
1,Blendtec company show's lack of integrity in standing behind their warranty.,30-Nov-16,No,"I have owned 2 blendtec blenders. The blender is great but the jar has been a real problem as you can see from many reviews. I had another jar wear out last week but I had a back up jar in the pantry so I threw the worn out jar away. Then I discovered that the jar in the pantry was in worse shape then the one I had thrown out. When I called customer service for warranty on the jar I had thrown out, they wanted a number off the bottom of the jar. I explained that I had thrown it away because I had a backup jar in the pantry which ended up being worn out also. Long story short, customer service would not replace the jar because I didn't have the numbers off the bottom even though my blender was within warranty. I am done with Blendtec! The jars have been such a problem for them that they resort to using loop holes in their warranty policy to not stand behind their product. They say the new jars are much better but the company has shown a real lack of integrity so I'm taking my business else where.",3
2,I was mislead by a Qigong guru...,28-Dec-14,No,"I just received this as a Christmas gift.  I have been wanting to get one for quite a while after attending one of Jeff Primacks Qigong seminars where he endorses this product.  He claims that its the best blender on the market because it has a 3 horsepower motor that can grind avocado pits.  I was sold on the idea of using food as medicine and making high fiber vegetable smoothies.  I have never been able to afford one of these because it was outside of my price range, so getting it as a Christmas gift was really special, to say the least.  I have not used it yet for reasons I will go into below.  In fact I am currently considering returning this for credit in exchange for a vita-mix.  By the way, I'm pretty sure this was purchased through Amazon.com, even though obviously I wasn't the one to buy it...Last night I opened the box and was surprised by certain ""new product"" odors coming out.  The lid to the jar seems to have a very bad smell to it.  The odor is like uncured vinyl or chemically-treated rubber.  It smells TOXIC!  I cannot use that with food!  It makes me hesitant to even try this out.  I suppose I may be able to wash the lid but most likely I would need a replacement.  I am guessing however that the lids are probably all be the same because they are mass-produced.  Maybe putting the lid through the dishwash or boiling it in superwashing soda(sodium carbonate) would do the trick -- but why should I be having to concern myself with this on a ""premium quality"" USA made product?  Talk about sticker shock, uh... Yeah!?  I will call to see if the Blendtec customer service can resolve this for me, but as far as first impressions go, things are not looking good right now.  I'm thinking I would much rather have gotten a vita-mix or other brand that has better parts as well as actual analog switches and dials instead of digital buttons.  I really don't trust the longevity of digital buttons because of how they wear out.  The button surface skin eventually cracks at which point the sensor begins to malfunction and the button stops working.  Thats not easily replaceable.  Analog copper switches do not have this problem...Getting on the amazon.com page for this blender, I decided to read the reviews.  As usual I start with the negative reviews first because they are usually the most informative.  I was surprised to see that there are almost 100 reviews below 3 stars.  If you divide the three star reviews and round half up/half down, you wind up with 703 positive and 109 negative reviews(including mine).  There are 812 reviews for this product including mine, as of the date I write this.  That means that almost 1 in 8 customers are unhappy with the product quality or performance.  Thats not a very good ratio people!?!..In perusing through the first couple pages of 1 stars reviews, I notice that a large majority of the complaints have to do with the seals failing on the bottom of the blender pitcher-jars.  Several people have stated that they noticed the seal gets shredded and winds up in the food.  In addition, the average lifespan(of the seal) seems to be no more than two years.  With a deficit like that, who really wants to put up with replacing an entire $60 - $100 pitcher every 24 months?  It is a waste of time and resources!!!  The seal should be self-serviceable and replaceable by the customer at home!!!  I've seen other people give 1 star reviews that state they have had basic &lt;$100 blenders as well as vita-mix brand blenders with seals that hold-fast for up to 30 years on some old-school models.  So then, why does Blendtec have such issues with the most basic of components?!!  I'm no rocket scientist, but I'm guessing that I could engineer a better seal that what these guys make.  Unless it is part of their business plan to sell junk to make money selling extra pitchers.  If it was my company, I would not make the seals some proprietary built in thing.  It is simply UNACCEPTABLE  that a ""commericial"" grade blender should have non user-serviceable blade-seals that fail in less than two years.  I don't care how powerful the motor is purported to be.  THAT IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE...The other people who have given low reviews also state that the motor appears to vent black dust out onto the countertop as well as leak liquid both directions through the pitcher seal.  If the seal in the pitcher is made with the same toxic-smelling material as the lid, then really, nobody should be consuming beverages made from it.  HEY BLENDTEC, EVER HEARD OF SILICONE??!  TRY USING SOME!  I'm not going to go into detail trying to breakdown all the other function failures that have been reported.  Suffice it to say that there are other apparent issues to do with the lack of blending thicker smoothies without the addition of extra liquid.  So much for 100% vegetable smoothies.  I see reviewers stating that they feel it has to do with the square shape of the blending pitcher and I would most likely agree.  Vita-mix uses a plunger which comes with standard with that brand.  Blendtec doesn't have one.  Big difference...My biggest issue right now is the obviously toxic Blendtec lid and my lack of faith in their ""proprietary"" non-user-serviceable, leaky, self-shredding unreliable blade-seals.  I have lost trust this device and am more than likely going to exchange it for a vita-mix.  I am not going to try using it before I talk to a Blendtec rep.  Apparently this company used to sell something called a K-tec commercial blender but it appears that they don't make it anymore.  Maybe after downgrading to consumer products they started using cheaper quality components.  I could never recommend this product at this point and catching up with the learning curve.....I should also mention that after inspecting the seal on the bottom of my pitcher I can see that part of the rubber grommet which turns with the blade shaft has a small harline cut in the seal itself.  I can see it!  Plus it looks like the blade shaft is poorly glued into the bottom of the pitcher; the glue job does not look clean and smooth.  I really don't trust this seal.  It even looks cheap.  It should NEVER LEAK OR SHRED, EVER.  You should be able to run the pitcher through your dishwasher on the bottom rack no-problem.  I'm looking at Vita-Mix and Waring blenders right now.  I have lost my faith in Blentec...Thanks.",6
1,It CAN'T handle the job.,22-Apr-16,No,"Don't buy it. The blender claim professional, but is NOT for professional use at all. I bought one for my juice store and the blender can't handle the job. The bearing of the jars starting vibrating with just 2 month's and this week (one year after i bought) the motor just stop. Show a message of overload even without jar and don't turn on... Don't work neither a year of not too much work (8 - 12 juices per day). Is very little job for a machine that claims professional use. So it CAN'T handle the job. I had a Vitamix for about 6 years and never had any major problem. The thing i had to replace in my vitamix is the driver socket, so you can imagine how much i use the vitamix. So be happy and buy a Vitamix and forget your problems.",5
5,This is a very powerful blender.,11-Oct-10,No,"The Blendtec blends frozen fruit without having to defrost at all, and also gets things really, really smooth.  I have never made such smooth hummus.  The Blendtec recipe for hummus includes whole seasame seeds--it blends them into tahini while making hummus--how sweet is that?..I tried a $40 blender that Consumer Reports rates as better than the Blendtec.  I broke it in one day when I tried to make hummus.  If you want to make anything with a consistency thicker than a margarita, I think you should consider an expensive blender.  I have been a quest for easy-blending for many years.  I used a mini-food processor for a long time, but I always felt it was on the verge of breaking and it always took a long time to make fruit smoothies because I always had to scrape things down and I used frozen fruit which always had to be defrosted a little bit.  I also tried a Magic Bullet, which is very successful, and I still use it when I want a single serving of something.  The main advantage of a Magic Bullet is that you can shake the whole thing, which is faster than scraping or tamping.  But again, I have to defrost frozen fruit slightly or I will smell burnt blender...The Blendtec is often compared to a Vitamix, which has a better warranty and has a tamper (used to push food into the blade).  Many people prefer the Vitamix because it gives them more control with a tamper.  The Blendtec has several preset programs that are designed to make sure everything gets blended without a need for a tamper by changing speeds at appropriate times.  But with the Blendtec, you can also control the spend yourself by pressing speed up and speed down.  I have never tried a Vitamix, but I picked the Blendtec over the Vitamix because it is smaller, lighter, and more attractive (I saw a Vitamix in person at Bed Bath and Beyond and wondered where I would put it).  The Blendtec is also criticized for having poor customer service.  I have not had it very long, so I can't comment on customer service.",4
5,Love this product! Highly recommend!,31-Jul-16,No,"LOVE this product!  This is my second Blendtec Blender!  When I saw it on sale I had to get a second one for our second home!  This is the absolute best blender I have ever owned! It's so easy to use and clean. Makes everything from smoothies to soups.  The easy to use buttons means you just load in your stuff and press the setting.  The blender does all the work!  Whole veggies or ice, this blender does a GREAT job!  HIGHLY recommend!",0
5,Does it Blend? Yes. Does it Leak? Yes!  Does it have Great Customer Service? YES!,23-Mar-17,No,Got the blender. Worked super well for three years.  But Ive literally used it less than 30 times. The other day it started leaking from the bottom where the jar connects to the motor.  Was kinda bummed.  Called their CS. Dude did a quick over the phone diagnosis and told me a replacement would be on its way.  Got the email confirmation on the replacement just a few mins earlier...These guys aren't messing around with their customer service.  Dude was super nice and didnt give me no hassle...P.S. the diagnosis was me turning the blade nub under the jar manually. And he was able to tell over the phone by the noise it made that it was leaking  Guess one that's in working condition would make no noise for those who wish to check their own.,0
1,GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE,14-Sep-16,No,GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. POS BLENDER !!! SECOND TIME I HAD TO SEN IT BACK FOR SERVICING. FIRST TIME THE BLUE LCD BOARD BLEW OUT. MUST OF USED IT LESS THAN 50 X. MOTOR BROKE WITH PIECES RATTLING AROUND. I BOUGHT IT NEW IN 2012. JAR (PITCHER) HAS BALL BEARINGS PACKED IN OIL THAT LEAKED DOWN MY BLENDER MOTOR. BUY A OSTERIZER BEEHIVE CLASSIC WITH REAL GLASS JAR ! NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY OSTERIZER BEEHIVE. HAD IT FOR OVER 20 YEARS. THIS PRODUCT IS HIGHER MAINTENANCE THAN A LAND ROVER  LOL ! DON'T BUY INTO THE HYPE !! I EXPECTED MUCH MORE IN AN AMERICAN BUILT PRODUCT !!! PS. GO TO THEIR WEBSITE AND HALF THEIR SELECTION IS REBUILT BLENDERS LOL..IT DIDN'T SIT GOOD WITH ME I BOUGHT A NEW PRODUCT FOR $500 AND NOW THEY'RE REPLACING IT WITH A REBUILT ONE FOR $185. STAY AWAY FROM THESE HUCKSTERS.,2
5,Don't let price scare you away,25-Jun-17,No,Wife purchased blendtech blender 3 years ago and when I found out how much it cost I was ready to divorce my wife. After using a few times I cooled off. After 3 years of using all the time for everything from drinks to tamales I have found this product to the best investment dollar for dollar we have ever made. These are great commercial blenders and would never try another brand. Thanks blendtech,0
5,... have had this machine for about 4 years its amazing no problems what so ever not with gaskets,24-Jul-17,No,"I have had this machine for about 4 years its amazing no problems what so ever not with gaskets, or jar, or motor its done everything from soup to nuts mostly used for smoothies and ice cream.. Its warranty is for 7 years.  I love this machine.  expensive yes but in my opinion worth every penny.",1
2,bad machine but great customer service,17-Mar-14,No,I purchased a new Blendtec in April 2011.  In just a few months it leaked what I thought was grease or something coming out the bottom.  Customer service acted like they didn't know what the problem was so they sent me a new machine and I paid a little extra for the wild side jar.  It was about a year later after a couple of blown lids with smoothie all over the place that the jar started leaking again and was making a grinding sound on start up a few times.  Again Customer service didn't know what the problem was but I received again a new machine and new jar.  I solved the exploding lid problem by using a flat bungee cord. Since I was now on my third machine and third Jar I finally gave up and returned it to Bed Bath and Beyond and got a full refund which I used to order a new Omega BL660.  I didn't want a Vita Mix because I didn't like having to use a tamper and I like the propeller blade.  Even Vita Mix puts a propeller blade on their commercial machines.  Blendtec blenders make great smoothies but I was concerned that when the 7 year warrantee ends I didn't want to have to be buying a new jar every year.  I will report on the Omega after a reasonable time.,3
3,Not as great as advertised,19-Jul-12,No,"We have had this blender for more than two years so I can give a long term review of this product. It should be noted that this blender was sent back to Blendtec after three months because it would not work correctly. When you pressed the pre-set speeds it would not start. Blendtec was good with the repair and paid all shipping costs. The major problem I have with this blender is that smoothies are never ""smooth"". There are always some chunks of ice or fruit that never get crushed completely. I give it 3 stars because this blender is just average.",5
5,A Kitchen Essential,22-Apr-07,No,"After about 2 months of comparing and searching, I decided to get a Blendtec.  At first, I was slightly disappointed with my new blender.  I had previously used a Vitamix, and I was used to the plunger.  I threw in half an apple and some other fruit to make a smoothie.  To my surprise, the apple was not blended up.  Since the blender was a gift, I decided that I would give it another chance.  Since that time, I have not had any more complaints.  The harder fruits and vegetables need to be cut once or twice to help them get sucked into the blades.  This amazing machine is a must for anyone who is in need of extra fruit and vegetable consumption. (That is just about everyone) I have used the blender over 70 times in the last 3 weeks.  It works flawlessly.  I highly recommend a high power blender for every kitchen, and the Blendtec is a very good choice...Pros: Flawlessly blends, easy to clean, easy to run, automatic shutoff, ultimate power!..Cons: slight food prep needed (nothing larger than 2 or 3 inches for harder items is ideal), loud, (FYI any blender that is high power is going to be making some noise), the accompanying recipe book has a few typos...Overall, I highly recommend this blender.",90
3,Another Blendtec Vs Vitamix Opinion,22-Dec-11,No,"I eat a raw food diet and use the blender almost everyday and several times. I owned a Vitamix for 6 months..I kept hearing how great Blendtec is. So recently I returned my Vitamix and purchase the Blendtec...It's true Vitamix is too tall, heavy and harder to get things out of..But I like the control I have better with Vitamix. I don't just make Smoothies...The Blendtec came with the 3 in. blade jar and I'm not too impressed with it..If you don't select the right button you have to push it again and it heats up whatever you have in it. I know you can stop it by pushing any button. But then it's not done so you still have to push another button to finish it and that's when it warms up.  And you do need to put liquid in for it to work properly.I don't want to add water to dilute what I'm making...With the Vitamix I didn't have to think about what button I'm pushing,  I just put everything in with or without liquid, shoved it down with the tamper and make it as smooth or chunky as I like. When you make a warm soup in the Vitamix you can let it swirl at the end if you want to throw some chunky stuff in and let it heat with the soup but not cream it. With the Blendtec you can throw something in at the end but you can only pulse it once to chop it and stop or it will cream...I've ordered the 4in blade Jar for the Blendtec because I heard that one is much better. So I'm giving it one more try. I wish I could combine the 2 blenders. The Blendtec is much sleeker and easier storeage,  I just don't like the buttons. So we'll see how it goes...Another thing, I really like Vitamix' customer service is better, I e-mailed Blendtec and they never got back to me..And the Vitamix demonstrater did not bad mouth Blendtec at the Costco roadshow. I can't say that for Blendtec.",21
5,I love this machine,22-Aug-17,No,"I love this machine. Pre programmed cycles plow through all i feed it. Liquifies flax and chia in a smoothie. Liquifies carrots, kale, apples. I love making whole plant smoothies with this.",1
2,not good for frozen fruit...,28-Jul-16,No,It doesn't handle frozen fruit (pineapple and strawberries) that well. I need to put a spoon into the lid hole to push the fruits and it feels really unsafe... I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or this machine is not as good as vitamix. I still can return it and buy a vitamix. I don't know what to do.,1
2,Go with Vitamix,25-Jan-16,No,"Purchased a Blendtec 570 Classic.  The machine performed very well, EXCEPT that the Teflon blender blade seal in the container will ""bleed"" small bits of Teflon into the container, and into your smoothie!  At first I thought these were simply blackberry seeds.  No chance.  It is a KNOWN issue with Vitamix, which has fixed the problem with their new containers.  THe FDA classifies this material as harmless, but why ingest a non-organic substance.  On top of that, if you try to get Blendtec customer service on the line, good luck.  I tried three times on one day with no success.  I'm out shopping for a new Vitamix right now.",2
1,Mostly hype! Not an all-around blender,21-Jul-13,No,"I have never written a product review on Amazon before, but I really feel compelled to help future purchasers of this blender out and  give them some prior information.  Everybody considering a Blendtec knows that it is an investment and they want to be sure their large investment will work properly and last.  Since I know it is really hard to compare other people's experience to your own expectations, given how differently we view things, I will try hard to just cover the facts.  To start with, I did not purchase my Blendtec at Amazon.  However, Amazon was a wealth of information for me from past purchasers and I am writing my review here to add to that pool.  If you are set on purchasing a Blendtec, you should go down to the nearest Bed, Bath and Beyond and order it in-store using a 20% off coupon.  You simply ask for free shipping because you are unwilling to pay the $30 and they authorize a ""customer accommodation"" no problem.  The coupon will save you $80 off the $400 price tag.  I also went on ebay and purchased store credit receipts for around 15-25% off the face value.  If you are like me and the $400 price tag just isn't reasonable, I ended up paying $280 out of pocket by using the above mentioned discounts...Before you purchase the blender you really need to identify what you will be using this blender for.  Like the old adage goes, ""A jack-of-all-trades is an expert of none"".  I decided to buy a new blender initially because I am making very big dietary changes that are setting me on a course for primarily raw foods and green smoothies.  This  blender claims that it can make sauces, dips, dressings, nut butters, green smoothies, soups and more. This is exactly what I needed and naively I thought I could evade buying a food processor if I purchased a more expensive blender that could do it all.  I lack a lot of cupboard and counter room, so consolidating is always attractive to me.  This unit is very small in comparison and will fit in any cupboard or nicely on small counters.  However, this blender cannot do it all.  It works adequately if you are making smoothies and some whole food juices, but not much else.  The blender needs a lot of liquid to create the vortex effect and the square jar is not intuitive because it impedes the flow of contents in the circular vortex.  Even in green smoothies with plenty of liquid I saw this problem.  When the fresh lettuce, kale or blueberry approached the corner it got stuck on the wall and never made it around.  The softer the green like spinach or red leaf lettuce, the better the result.  If you only use spinach you will have no problems.  When the fruit was frozen I did not have any problem either.  The dull blade construction is very poor at emulsifying food.  The blades are very very dull.  I made a raw ""cheesy"" red bell pepper coating with soaked cashews to put on kale chips. When the dip came out the entire skin of the pepper was scattered throughout in big strips of skin.  The blender could not process the skin of tomato either in a whole foods V8 juice.  The thin skins of blueberries created a problem for the blender as well.  Cavitating (blades spinning in a pocket of air) was by far the biggest problem I experienced.  Even with adding more liquid then I should have, I would have to turn the unit off 5-10 times to scrape and reposition ingredients to make a dressing or dip.  The manufacturer recommends that you buy separate jars for dry and wet goods if you intend to process nuts or grains a lot as pitting and scratches are inevitable.  I only processed soaked and softened nuts three times and coffee beans once in the 5 days I had the blender.  By day 4 I noticed a ring of fogged discoloration blade high on the jar and hairline scratches.  The plastic jar is very cheaply built and hurt easily.  The blender lid is a combination of a black suction cup like lid with a hole in the middle and a plastic cup with four prongs that sits inside the hole.  Food contents are flung up to the top of jar when blending and easily exit through the plastic top. Food gets trapped there between the plastic cup and the black suction piece...If you are considering this blender please keep in mind the following pros and cons.  The pros are mainly the 7 year warranty, the very powerful 1500 watt motor, the all digital sleek design and the small construction which makes it the right size for any kitchen.  The settings actually process food according to the food density and do adjust mid-setting if it feels a change in texture or density...The cons are the following: Dull blades cannot cut through thin skins of fruits or vegetables, square jar and flat bottom traps outer contents on the jar wall, cavitating during food processing occurs without lots of help from liquids and scraping, I attempted ground coffee once and it did no better of a job then my $9 coffee grinder, tough greens do not get processed all the way, jar is damaged easily with normal use (again I had mine 4 days and damage already occurred) and lastly the price tag does not reflect quality it reflects hype.  I fell into the trap of thinking I needed the really powerful motor to process heavy ingredients like nuts and ice without over heating the unit.  Initially I was going to purchase the Breville 800BLXL with a 1000 watt motor and the most innovative and complementary design in jar and blade construction on the market.  The lower grade 750 watt model actually out performed the Blendtec in videos I watched done by real scientists.  I bought this blender instead for the  warranty and the motor.  I ended up with a blender that could not produce any of the dishes I bought it for.  Don't fall for the hype.  I returned my Blendtec and bought the above mentioned Breville blender and will review that one as well once I test it out.  Purchase a blender with a circular jar, at least four blades that extend as far out to the side of the jar as possible to create a no dead-zone (a large dead-zone is a very big problem for the Blendtec) and enough power to blend.  The first time I used this blender I blew the GFI circut in my kitchen outlet!  You really don't need that much power.  I hope this was helpful.",55
5,Completely Met Expectations,8-Jul-11,No,"I wanted a high powered blender to make black raspberry smoothies, but didn't want to spend a lot. After all, I thought ""how much could a really do with a blender""...So, I tried several cheap knockoffs including the Ninja system. Every one still left whole black raspberry seeds in my smoothies...After a TON of research on the Vitamix and the Blendtec I decided I wanted one. Mostly due to Amazon's ability to ship me the Blendtec right away for the same price I decided on the TB-621-20 model. After all, I had 3 lbs of fresh black raspberries that were wasting away!..I got the blender and immediately made a black raspberry smoothie. There were some seeds, much to my chagrin. So, I ran the blender on ""smoothie"" setting a 2nd time. This time the seeds were noticeably broken up. I won't lie and say it disentegrates them, but it did chop them up so that they were barely noticeable. My 6 year old could not tell the seeds were still there. The thing will chew up just about anything else, however. I added Peaches and Mango, all with the skins on. Raw vegetables and even meats (bad experiment in a smoothie) will just get obliterated into puree...Since the first smoothie, I have used the blender just about everyday, much to my surprise. I have made Ice Cream, bread crumbs, fresh peanut butter (which is REALLY cool) and of course smoothies. I really am getting my money's worth. Just having the blender out on the counter, easily accessible makes me want to use it for things, I probably would have used other tools for in the past...It has completely met my expectations. I highly recommend it.",7
1,Blendtec was a great blender for about 2 years,4-Feb-17,No,"Blendtec was a great blender for about 2 years.  We make lots of smoothies, and the whole family liked it.  (Vitamix blends better -- some veggies get stuck in the sides of the Blendtec that we have to manually push down and then reblend -- but we bought the Blendtec as the appliance size fits under most standard kitchen cabinets  whereas the Vitamix didn't.  At the two year mark, the gasket at the bottom of the blending jar broke.  The company sent us a new one after several weeks.  Now, a few months later, the motor is broken.  ( The metal ring that the blending jar fits in is stripped and literally flew out of the blender base!)  The machine is nonfunctional.  I have contacted the company twice about the malfunction, and they will not return my phonecalls or emails.  This machine was far too expensive to break at 2 years of standard use!..Vitamix is now shorter and will fit on counters.  We just bought a Ninja ( much cheaper)  which, so far, is working well...Don't get stuck with poor Blendtec customer service!",0
5,BUY ONE!,8-Feb-14,No,"I did not buy this on amazon, i bought it at Costco. I am terrified of buyers remorse so I was skeptical to buy it even after the great demo in the store. Let me tell you, I loooove this blender. I am kind of a blender snob and I hate when I have to open the lid to stir everything around and shake the blender to death because the blades get stuck, the belndtec does not do that!!! Its seriously amazing and 100 dollars cheaper than the vitamix at Costco. the only thing is that its very loud. I mean, it sounds like a boat in my kitchen, but it doesnt take long to blend anything so its not too bad ;)",0
4,Would buy again,16-Apr-16,No,Purchased this to replace a 6 year old KitchenAid Model KSB1570 whose drive coupler had striped and jar was leaking.  Love this new blender.  It does a way better job then my old blender and has presets to take away all the guess work.  Well worth the $200 I paid (vs $100 for KitchenAid)). Ultimately I deducted one star because I am not sure if it will be as durable as a Vitamix.  Only time will tell.,0
4,Vitamix vs Blendtec from personal experience,22-Nov-10,No,"I've had the pleasure of using both machines for many years..I used to work at Robeks where they swore by the Blendtec, and my mother beams a Vitamix.  I use both frequently, the Vitamix now more since I don't work at Robeks any more.. My verdict is that like others have wisely stated, you will be a winner with either of these machines. However, depending who you are and what your requirements are, there are slight differences. The major points are:..1.  Vitamix outperforms the Blendtec. It is very slight, but I never have to bang my Vitamix against the counter like I had to with my Blendtec blender because how well it dices all the ingredients.  Don't get me wrong, Blendtec still will put your home blender to shame...2.  The Blendtec looks nicer than the Vitamix. It is true. I will probably end up buying the Blendtec when I finish college simply because it is more compact and it looks great (the blue light!)...3. Sound? Well, like that other guy stated, you won't hear any aircraft taking off and it's not one for a mother who is always trying to put her baby to sleep haha.  Still, the results justify the noise. It's to be expected. I would have to say that the Vitamix is slightly quieter, because when my room door is near shut, I cannot hear it from the kitchen (we live in close-quarters in Hawaii).  With the Blendtec, you can be in a whole other store in the mall and best believe you will hear the smoothies grinding (it's a selling point apparently, who knew?)...That's about all that matters to me. They both produce delicious smoothies and in record time. As in regards to whose warranty is better and so on, I've heard Vitamix has a better policy but it's not something I've ever researched because these machines are like the Hondas of the smoothie world. They are work horses and they last forever! At Robeks, they never get the blades sharpened or the machines tuned up. My mother's Vitamix has never given her problems to date...I am more familiar with the operation of a Blendtec and produced better smoothies with it (because of the formulas), and I kind of enjoyed banging top against the counter. It made me feel like I was working for this smoothie's perfection! haha",23
4,Works great; company could communicate better when there's a problem.,10-Jan-14,No,"I bought my blendtec over 2 years ago at Costco.  We use it pretty frequently, though not daily until recently, and it works great. Ice cream, smoothies, milks for my milk-sensitive girl . . . Until a few weeks ago - just in time for Christmas, when the black stuff I had noticed under the jar got into my coconut milk - it should NOT be gray! So I pulled out the receipt and called the company. No problem!  New jar on the way.  Then they called back &amp; said I might want to let someone listen to it to make sure that was the only problem.  I did and guess what!  I get a new base too - it had been sounding pretty rough, and it wasn't changing speeds like it should. Yay!  Maybe 10 days later, reconditioned base &amp; new jar arrived.  I knew I needed to send the old base back, but there was no info included on how to do that - just a return label.  So a couple weeks later, I realized it was still sitting around - no email, no call, no info on how to get it picked up, or if I need to notify blendtec.  So I called UPS - turns out it's $13 for them to pick it up.  Not a huge deal to drop it off, but it would have really been nice for them to tell me that's what I would need to do. And in response to another review about the jar seal being a common problem after 2 years and a 3 year warranty, they said my warranty was actually 8 years, so they may have to replace a couple more jars, but I think I can deal with that.  Overall I think it was a good investment, given the length of the warranty.",0
3,It should be a 2 but their customer service makes it a 3,10-Jun-13,No,"I use this blender at least once or twice a day, and have for over a year. IT certainly does what it's supposed to do - blend the heck out of anything..On the other hand it has to be the world's loudest blender. I wear ear protection when I run it on high speed. You'll be deaf if you don't..The lid has blown its way off 3 or 4 times and thrown its contents all over the kitchen. When I'm blending dry things, like oats to make oat milk, the lid always has to be held in place or else there'll be oat flour all over the counter..It's not just THIS lid, because this is my third unit in 18 months. The Blendtec comes with a 7 year warranty, and the company has made it good every time. No complaints there.??<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Blendtec-TB-621-20-Total-Blender-Black/dp/B000GIGZXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blendtec TB-621-20 Total Blender, Black</a>",4
5,You must own one of these!!!!,31-Oct-17,No,I can't believe we waited so long to own this blender.  Love it!  We use it for juicing and it works great.  Very light weight.  We take it along on our RV trips.  The plastic pitcher is awesome and so easy to clean!,0
5,This is the best blender in the world,19-Aug-10,No,"This was an unexpected wedding gift. I'd added it to our registry as a joke (because of the will it blend series of videos)...I'm eternally thankful to the friend who bought this for us because it's seriously the best blender I have ever used. I never doubt my ability to blend things. I never worry that this run will be the last time it crushes ice. I never fear that I've put too many bits of fruit or frozen pieces in it. It just works...I've been through three lesser blenders at approx 40-60 bucks a piece and still not used them in total as many times as I've used the Blendtec. The others just died...Maybe I'm hard on blenders... who knows...Anyway, WELL worth the price.",2
5,Blends like a beast!,16-Aug-17,No,"I use this almost exclusively for my morning smoothies after gym time or morning runs. I throw various frozen fruits, spinach, protein powder and this handles it well. By comparison, I have busted a nutribullet using the same ingredients.",0
5,Blend Machine with looks,1-Dec-13,No,"It's been a month since I have purchased this blender.  This has replaced the Magic bullet, a stone grinder and a bread dough maker in our house. The motor roars like an engine and I have ground(err...blended) brown rice, whole wheat kernels, ice cubes, whole beets and lentils. The various settings on the front panel are convenient so I don't have to remember the timings. Similar to a microwave with settings for popcorn, reheat etc...This blender does need a flat surface. I placed it on the carpet, trying to test if the noise decreases. Wouldn't advise that. Find a flat hard surface, press the right button and you can walk away. A few times, I had to blend twice for grains like wheat and rice. This blender wins in 2 dimensions of the faster-better-cheaper axes. It's faster than any other device I have used in the kitchen. The food is better because it doesn't contain any preservatives, super fresh and delicious with no added sugars. It's cost is the only factor that may inhibit some people. If you use this on a daily basis, you'd save time and gain health. A big value for the price !",0
3,I love my blendtec then why I have given it a ...,14-Dec-15,No,"I love my blendtec then why I have given it a 3 star? Because the seal on the Jar deteriorates about every two years and the jar starts leaking. There is a 7-year warranty on the jar. Blendtec have replaced it without a question but it is still annoying. I use my blender every day, a couple of times a day so waiting for a new jar 7-10 days (delivery time) is very annoying. Otherwise I would have given this a 5-star.",3
5,BEST BLENDER ON THE MARKET!!!,5-Jan-13,No,"I tried a Vitamix while staying at a friends' house over the summer then realized it was a bit difficult to clean the long jar and was a bit oversized and unsightly on the counter.  I liked it otherwise but I couldn't commit to the hefty purchase price so I bought a Ninja instead.  Mistake.  It didn't even blend all the ingredients in my morning shakes.  The design allows the razor sharp blade the fall out and it cut my hand the first time I tried to pour my drink.  I didn't like having that sharp elongated blade in my sink or dishwasher either.  I returned it to Costco thanks to their gracious return policy.  I took a deep breath, and purchased a Blendtec Total Blender.  I can't say enough about it.  I blends.  Everything.  Completely.  The first time.  Including ice...There are no razor sharp blades or tall narrow jars to clean.  I drink protein shakes nearly daily with various ingredients such as Chia seeds, spinich, celery, apples, ice, etc. and the Blendtec turns these items into a smooth blended conncoction without any chunks or leaves or stalks leftover.  It's amazing.  I have tried Cesar salad dressing and my chocolate mousse.  Soon I'll get the nerve to try peanut butter.  One word of warning:  I have the new Twister Jar with tines that come down from the lid to act like a spatula on thick ingredients.  This jar does not work for my shakes because it's small and the lid will come off spraying liquid all over.  It's intended for thick stuff like Hummus and peanut butter.  I use the Wildside jar now for my drinks and it's a pretty good size for that and easy to clean too.  I haven't figured out how to use all the buttons to get the 96 someodd combination blending/program options, but the 4 buttons I currently use have the speeds and shut-off timer to make this simple to use.",1
5,"Best $400 I""ve spent",15-Aug-11,No,"I have had my Blentec for 18 months plus and I use it at least once a day.  I recommend getting a second jug because one is always dirty and you may want a bigger one..I went with Blendtec instead of Vitamix for 3 reasons: bigger motor, shorter and will fit under kitchen cabinets, also jug is shorter so you don't get stuff on your arm when scraping it out. and Finally, the seal-the-deal reason. Vitamix was taken to court by Blentec because they stole the technology for the 5-sided jug AND WON. A David vs Goliath scenerio and that spoke volumes to me about the intergrity of the Vitamix Corp. I still use my bullet to make ranch dressing but that's about it.",3
1,the worse blender and even worse customer service,23-Sep-15,No,blender is extremely loud.  jar spills if not being held whilst on blender.  purchased 2 jars and both had blade failure issues after a year and blendtec refused to honor warranty...Extremely disappointed with blender.  don't ever buy this blender.  purchase vitamix instead.,5
5,Glorious,16-Jul-17,No,"I bought this on prime day, got a great deal. Love it so far, it has an 8 year warranty. My old blender is still kicking at 12 years old but I really wanted this blender to replace it and the price was right that one day that one time.",0
5,"Green smoothies, soups and almond butter at your fingertips",6-Jul-16,No,"Love the BlendTec Blender! It makes great green smoothies, really macerating the kale, spinach, ice cubes, apples, really anything I want into a smooth healthy beverage. It's also great for a quick tomato soup or even for making almond butter. It is super easy to clean--the blades are not sharp, so that makes it much easier to do deep cleans. Mostly, I just rinse and then pulse for 5 seconds with 8oz of water and a squirt of dish detergent--voila! Clean in seconds. If you plan to make green smoothies, save a bit and choose the BlendTec over the Vitamix. Better value for your hard-earned money.",1
1,Worst customer service imaginable,11-Feb-15,No,"Worst customer service imaginable. Purchased on 12/20/14- never worked properly. The gasket on the jar disintegrated within the first few uses resulting in disgusting black liquid leaking everywhere. Called customer service repeatedly for weeks- no one ever answers! Finally today when I got through to a cs rep, I was told that because I am now outside of the 30 purchase window, the best replacement available is a refurbished model. Not acceptable on a $300+ appliance that we've only had for 6 weeks. Beware of this company- just buy a Vitamix and save yourself the headache.",7
5,Had it for forever.,27-Apr-16,No,"Don't know if this is a newer model or not. We bought ours several years ago, but have used it enough that the times-used counter is at 9925. Never had a problem. We've been through so many blenders, but this one is RELIABLE.",1

Its one of my favorite purchases, ever; I highly recommend this product.",0
4,Power Switch Failed after ~ 1000 uses ( 1 year ),3-Nov-13,No,"We are really happy with the functionality of the blender.  Blends everything we have thrown at it.  The power switch did ""fail"" on us.  The unit would flash for a second when you toggled the switch and then go off.  I opened the unit and found the connector from the outlet to with switch had come loose.  I pushed it back on and all is well.  Considering how much the thing vibrates it is not too surprising the connector came loose.  Hopefully they can either change the design or increase quality control.  It only took a second to fix so I can not complain too much.",2
5,A heaven sent!,17-Oct-15,No,"This blender was given to me as a hand me down when my inlaws got a Ninja blender. This blender can be used on anything, and will blend, grind, purify, mix, chop, you name it, anything you need, in seconds! In fact, they regretted replacing it with a Ninja but we refused to give it back LOL",1
5,Dependable and hard working,4-Dec-13,No,"I've had my blendtec blender for five years and I could not be happier. My wife and I use the blender daily and were wearing out blenders every six months.

Well, it paid for itself long ago and expect to be just as happy five years from now.",1
5,Perfection,26-Mar-12,No,"I was always wondering why the smoothies I purchased in stores tasted so much better than ones I tried making at home. This was their secret! I started using this blender for making healthier smoothies to cut weight and it sure did help my diet seam less miserable...While it is expensive, you get what you pay for and that is quality and power. This could puree a 5lb iron weight. :P..One note: The plastic jar doesn't stay clear for long.",1
2,they simply cut into frozen products better. I also read that the warrant on the ...,27-Dec-16,No,"I decided to shell out some money for a Blendtec at Costco.  I had the same questions with Blendtec v.Vitamix, etc. but what I really questioned was why pay $350.00 for blender.  I thought because it has a ten year warranty, thats why you shell out this kind of money.  The two things I need a blender for is for making Smoothies with frozen strawberries and other fruit and the other is for milk shakes.  Sadly, the Blendtec can do neither well. I have read reviews galore and the Blendtec simply cannot handle frozen strawberries.  (three horse power blender cant chop a strawberry?  The strawberries jam the mechanism and require constant work moving things around adding more liquids, etc and eventually you get a smoothie.  Milkshakes?  The Machine could not handle the ice cream and overheated causing it to shut down.  By the time I added enough Milk to help it work, I no longer had a shake but a cold drink. This has never happened with a Ninja or some of the cheaper  blenders I have purchased.  My theory? The Blendtec has a rather long blade with just two edges.  Other blenders use a four blade system, shorter and have different angles on the blade, they simply cut into frozen products better.  I also read that the warrant on the Blendtec does not extend to the contained with the blade installed. When these go out, its a hundred dollar replacement.  We took ours back to Costco after two months.  (I hate taking anything back to a store)  This just simply disappointed us.  We went out and bought a Ninja for 89 dollars which do what we need it to do.",1
5,This thing is awesome. I don't have to suffer through gritty chewy ...,7-Dec-16,No,This thing is awesome. I don't have to suffer through gritty chewy smoothies any more. I have only done smoothies so far but this blender seems capable of a lot more. Can't wait to try more stuff with it.,0
5,The only blender I ever needed.,13-Jul-16,No,"I have had this blender for six years now and finally the jar started leaking.  And they are replacing it because it is an 8 year warranty.  Where do you find stuff made in the USA carrying that much warranty anymore.  And it is the only blender that I have used so much!  In the past, I have purchased blenders with lots of parts that cost around $100 or less and use it like once or twice because it is so hard to clean.  This one, you clean it with soap and water and run a blend and leave it to dry and not let water sit in it or it sit in water and it will love you back.",1
5,LOVES IT!!!!!,3-Apr-12,No,"Ive been looking into buying a Blendtec for quite some time now, because of the hefty price I wanted to shop around and read as many reviews as possible first. I felt the BlendTec, with its pre-programmed buttons, would be much more user friendly than it's competitor Vitamix. While reading reviews on here (Amazon) I noticed that one buyer purchased hers from Costco for only $399. This was an excellent deal because it included the Fourside jar AND the Wildside jar which is usually an additional $99. So anywho, Ive since received my wonderful blender and cant be happier! Ive made countless smoothies,almond milk, salsa, soups, nut butter, etc. The list could go on! Yes it is a bit pricy, but if healthy living is your goal, it is well worth the investment.Not to mention it came with an 8 year warrenty.",2
5,Awesome customer service,27-Sep-17,No,I've been using a blendtec blender for years. It finally bit the dust and the company is replacing both the motor and jar free of charge. Can't beat that customer service and warranty!,1
1,I really wanted to write a good review but....,1-Sep-13,No,"I had this blender for 29 days.  It worked great.  It would blend anything.  Then the grommet under the carafe failed.  I had pieces of grommet in my smoothie and on the counter.  I was so mad.  I bought this over the Vitamix because it is made in my state and it just looked sleeker.  Well apparently I made a wrong choice...Blendtec did write me and told me I should exhange my carafe, but I just returned it.  Why should I keep a blender that can't even last 30days??  I had a 30.00 Sunbeam last a whole year before the glass carafe cracked...My advice  is not buy this product until they can fix the issue with the grommet and carafe...BTW I washed it by hand, did the twist thing after washing and only made green smoothies with it.",13
5,The Right Choice,1-May-13,No,"I've used it 1-3 times daily since I've purchased this. And I am most happy about the fact that I can have perfectly pureed organic baby food in seconds with easy cleanup. It is really the only other appliance that gets this much mileage (of course the coffee machine does too). I haven't touched my food processor in months! Sometimes I still stay around for the Vitamix demo at Costco, but I am satisfied that I got the Blendtec (also at Costco).",0
5,Five Stars,30-Nov-17,No,Absolutely a great blender. Super easy cleanup and plenty of power. It does not disappoint.,0
5,Great Blender!!!!! Great Company!!!!!,12-Aug-12,No,"""Unhappy in Seattle"" is now VERY HAPPY!! My original rating was one star because of problems that developed (see below), but when I looked at their website I found that the blender has a seven year warranty. Problem was that I could not find the sales slip. I took a chance and called Blentec. The woman I spoke to was amazing!!!! Bottom line by giving her some numbers on the base of the unit and the number on the jar, she was able to find when I purchased the blender. She gave me a repair number and they will repair or replace it under the warranty. If that is not service, I do not know what is. And I do love the blender. So I am one thrilled Blendtec owner. If you ever have problems with your blender call them. They are great and the blender is, too!!!!..MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: After about 3 years and 307 uses of programed cycles (as recorded on the display screen) this died except for the pulse and smoothie buttons. Before it died I loved it. Now I want to cry. I will not buy another and do NOT recommend this. Costco's site mentions problems with smoking and other dysfunctions after very minimal use.",0
5,Blentec is great. Fits under the counter,6-Jul-15,No,"I can only say that for my family, Blentec is great.  Fits under the counter, blends frozen food without a tamper into smooth juice and it stops by itself when the job is done. We use it an average of twice a day. Both my wife and I have our own jars for individual custom drinks, etc. Up to 747 uses with no problems whatsoever.  Manual wash with a squirt of dish soap, pulse and rinse.  The smooth jar makes it easy to keep clean.",2

1,Terrible performance for a $300,3-Dec-17,No,The gaskets on both jars melted. Liquid drained out the bottom. I've looked up reviews and this seems to happen a lot. Terrible performance for a  $300.00 blender. I haven't called the company yet. There are mixed reviews about that. Some people got their money back and others didn't.,3
5,Amazing.,13-Oct-18,No,My best furniture in the kitchen.,0
5,Fantastic Blender,18-Nov-15,No,"like many reviews on here, i did exhaustive research on the blendtec and vitamix.  i chose the blendtec due to the larger horsepower and the ease of use.  if you load the blender right, you just hit smoothie, walk away, come back and you have a perfectly blended drink everytime.  another plus is that it's very easy to clean compared to other blenders (including vitamix).  i'm sure the vitamix is a boss machine too, but this blendtec is the boss hoss.  :",1
5,AWESOME PRODUCT,25-Sep-12,No,"This product is amazing. It is so easy to use AND CLEAN!!!! I've only had it a few days but I have made smoothies galore (Spinach and banana as a base - YUM!), tomato soup (without any preservatives), and hummus. Great way to get healthy with no hassle. I have yet to try out the wild side (think that is what its called) that goes with it but im sure it will come in handy for larger dishes.",0
5,A blender with a lawnmower motor?,29-May-08,No,"I am a smoothie person who drinks at least one smoothie a day. I got tired of spending ten minutes a day making smoothie with one of the cheap blenders, so I decided to buy a more high powered blender...The Breville 550 was my first choice for its reasonable price/power and great looks. Unfortunately, my first smoothie was a disaster. I filled the smoothie 2/3 with fruits and ice, and I stood there pushing the smoothie button three consecutive times to no avail. Then I smelled something burning and figured it was the motor. After spending 10 minutes getting the thing to make smoothie, the result was no better than my old cheap Cuisinart blender. Apparently, 610 watts is just not enough if you want to make thick, smooth smoothie...I promptly returned the Breville. I then went on a mission to research for a real blender. Apparently, when it comes down to power and industrial strength blenders, it comes down to either a Vita-Mix or a Blendtec. A Costco near me had a demo for Blendtec so I decided to buy one there to try out...Wow! Now this is a blender! This thing sucked the fruits and ice down into its vortex amazingly well. With the ""Whole Fruits"" button, I had great smoothie in 50 seconds or less. I usually just hit the button and go the bathroom. By the time I get back, I got instant smoothie! I've tried the the ice crush button and this mode literally makes snow; not just crushed ice, but snow!..There is a con though. Without a tamper, sometimes the fruits do get stuck and doesn't go down. When that happens, I take the jar out and shakes it a couple times and blend again. It works every time. It's an extra step, but it sure beats standing there and holding a tamper to push the fruits down for entire blending time. Many reviewers here claim that they wished they had a tamper, but I think it may be due to their preference and how they've always done it with their Vita-mix. It isn't wrong, but there are more than one way to skin a cat, and for me, shaking it is much easier than using a tamper...It's also very easy to clean. Instead of disassembling the jar like the Breville and other blenders in its class, I just put a dash of detergent, fill it 1/3 with water, and pulse it for 5 secs. I then wash it out further with water, no dishwasher needed...Since I bought this at Costco, I got a full 7 year warranty. It's a lot of money, but since there are no alternatives at a cheaper price, it does make my decision easier. Considering the Breville blender probably would've smoked and blown within 6 months of the abuse I'd subject it to, a $400 blender that lasts a minimum of 7 years is not a bad deal. So far after a week of use, I've blended a total of 38 times (the LCD displays the # of uses on its front.). I think I may just keep it...Pros: It blends virtually anything!.  Lots of power. Doesn't smoke when it gets stuck..  Easy to clean..  It doesn't require you to stand there with a tamper..  Great warranty..  Makes amazing smoothies and margaritas and mixed drinks...Cons: Occasionally requires a good shake to loosen things up..  Expensive..  Loud. (although with a 3HP motor, it's actually quiet compared.  to my lawnmower. LOL).  Have to buy it at Costco for the 7 year warranty.",234
5,Superb,19-Aug-17,No,"I waited a long time to get a Blendtec. It's exactly as amazing as you've heard. Easy to clean, blends anything, superb build quality.",0
3,Help!! food stuck under the blade and cant remove,15-May-16,No,"I ordered a blendtec refurbished model about 2 months ago, I have used it almost everyday since. It blends smoothies perfectly, but I recently found a piece of stringy food probably a vegetable lodged under the blade and wrapped around the rubber gasket holding down the blade. It is impossible to reach it and get it out. I have pulsed it with soapy water and let it sit and have had no luck. I know it will form bacteria and it needs to be removed but I don't know if removing the blade is a good idea (or if its possible to without sending it to blendtec) Blendtec I need help! It would be a shame to waste the wildside jar because there's food stuck under the blade and it won't come out. I always pulse with soapy water after I use it so I don't get how this food has stayed on. Please help :( I need to keep making smoothies",2
1,Colossal waste of money!,15-Oct-17,No,"I have had this blender for under three years and have considered it to be a colossal waste of money. So much so, I do not think it is worthy of a single star rating. For starters, it was purchased to make smoothies. You would think paying $400 for a blender that a smoothie would be a walk in the park; it cannot blend ice, frozen berries or anything icy cold for that matter. The shape of the jar does not allow it to work effectively - the smoothie will cavitate and stay in that position. Since I experienced this ongoing problem, I quit using the Blendtec (having only used it for 5 months) and I bought a Ninja Professional 900 for $99: the Ninja blows the Blendtec away!!!!!!!! Two months ago, I got the Blendtec out to do some standard blending - no frozen stuff. I used it for about three weeks and I noticed the jar was leaking. The plastic around the blade bearings broke. I looked into a replacement jar: $110! Oh, one more thing: this thing is so loud it is deafening!  No kitchen devise should be this loud. I honestly have ear muffs that I use it. No joke..Do yourself a favor: do not waste your money - you WILL BE UNHAPPY!",0
5,Buy it. You will love it.,20-Jul-18,No,I have used Blendtec for years. 8 year warranty. Great buy highly recommend.,0
3,Excellent Blender - Blendtec vs Vitamix,18-Jan-12,No,"After reading all the research docs on Blendtec vs Vitamix, we decided to go with Blendtec for few reasons:.Size - Blendtec is way smaller and looks nice;.Controls - Pre-configured buttons for specific tasks in Blendtec is appealing since we don't have to worry about starting slow and moving to higher speed etc..;.Tamper free - Blendtec does not need any tamper or spoon like device to push solid food during blending..One negative comment on Blendtech is that it is LOUD! I have read reviews that Vitamix is little quieter. Regardless, we are happy with this choice.",4
5,Used daily; great for green smoothies and baby food,20-Feb-11,No,"We bought our Blendtec Valentines' Day 2010 and have used it almost everyday.  We make green smoothies for breakfast and green smoothies or weight gainer smoothies for our neighbor with cancer.  It was great when our baby started solids and we'd throw fresh, raw food into it and blend it up and store leftovers for him in ice cube trays.  We could blend up our dinner and give it to him as well when he was in that stage.  It is loud when it blends certain foods/ice but it has never caused our toddler to wake up.  It is easy to wash.  It fits under our cabinets (15"" high).  It enables us to get more greens into our diet in the morning as opposed to just later in the day.  Even our 2 year old loves green smoothies- that are mostly greens, as opposed to mainly fruit like some ""green smoothie"" recipes.  All our recipes have turned out the right consistency.  We love that we are getting living raw greens!",1
5,and do love it. The only thing is that don't put ...,4-Aug-17,No,"I got this from prime day, and do love it. The only thing is that don't put too much liquid/food that exceed the line, it will spill over. Otherwise works well",0
5,Outstanding product and customer service,15-Oct-14,No,"I'm sick and tired of throw away appliances from the big brands you find at Walmart.  They look good on the shelf and are pretty inexpensive.  Invariably, these Chinese made goods end up broken and in the garbage after about a year..Not so with the Blendtec blender.  I've had this blender over a year, using it twice a day, every day.  It is awesome.  I'm confident I will be using this blender for a decade.  The customer service is first class.  They really stand by their product.  Would not hesitate to purchase another Blendtec product.",1

Not at all worth the money,19-Jul-18,No,"Bought this the other day got it today and it is going back tomorrow :( It is very, very loud and it doesn't chop ice up well at all. My Kitchen Aid blender does a better job. Not at all worth the money. Very disappointed.",0
3,Not that great,17-Aug-12,No,I purchased the Blendtec and although it has a powerful motor I found myself using the settings 4-5 times in order to make one smoothie with frozen fruit and juice. I had plenty of juice in the jar and it kept mixing it on the bottom and not pulling the top stuff down. Other times I had to remove the lid various times and mix it as it would create a bubble around the blade just like my cheaper kitchenaid blender. It worked as well as my kitchenaid but for about three times the price. I returned it and got a second one and it was just like the first so I returned it again.,4
4,blending options have been good so far,23-Aug-16,No,blending options have been good so far. Easy to clean and i like the automatic programs for all blending styles. You can choose and option and walk away and not have to stand there until its done.,0
4,Blendtec total blender,22-Aug-12,No,"Overall very good blender. Not sure if it really justifies $400 price. There are at least a few other blenders in $ 200-300 price range that work really well...However, my wife has been ogling this  blender for a while and I guess her happy smile is worth the extra $150.",2
5,This is great and must have for every home,5-Jan-14,No,"This was a big purchase for me and my husband, but now after having it for 6 months I cannot live without it..I use it mainly for my healthy smoothies during the week, soups and milkshakes on the weekend. I got a new one from the ""C"" warehouse online. This is on sale right now (Jan 2014) for $360 including the wildside jar, blender machine and twister jar. I recommend you buy it there and get yourself a membership if you do not have it yet. I do not think any other place will beat their price right now and they have an awesome return policy as well.",1
5,Great product,13-Jun-08,No,"I have enjoyed thoroughly the performance of this impressive machine!  I have owned it for a couple of months, so I can't comment on the durability of the blender...It comes with a great recipe book with numerous types of food that one can prepare with the blender.  I have used a couple of the recipes with success.  The primary purpose of this blender in our household, however, is smoothie creation.  It performs flawlessly for this function.  Unlike cheaper brand blenders, the Blendtec totally emulsifies any ingredients, including ice, into a truly ""smooth"" smoothie...It has proven to be easy to clean, operate, and fits nicely on our counter underneath the kitchen cabinets...Highly recommended!",11
5,Smooth operator,7-Apr-09,No,"I just got my Blendtec HP3A blender today and I could not be more thrilled.  However, to be completely honest, I did experience a few hiccups in the first few cycles when I initially (and gleefully) jam packed the hopper with ice, placed the lid on top and turned it on full blast.  The incredibly high-speed blades virtually vaporized the lower cubes and kept the rest of the ice from falling down into the madly whirring blades...As I washed out the finely powered snow and frightened ice I considered my next attempt. Perhaps a little discouraged, but undaunted, I stuck some whole carrots and cucumbers in the container and pressed various buttons trying to get it to do what I anticipated it should do and in the way I thought it should do it. It didn't...So, a bit grumpy, confused and mildly frustrated, I read the manuals (Mac users rarely do this). A short time later, thus armed with pertinent, and essential operational information I confidently approached my new, white Blendtec HP3A and found, once again, that all upsets are caused by a lack of communication. In this case, my upset could have been avoided if I had first taken the time to read the excellent and informative Blendtec Recipe Book (It's amazing how facile things become when you know what you're doing!)...Oh my god! This thing is sweet! Using the pulse and a touch of RO filtered water I made the best cucumber and carrot smoothie on the planet... and in seconds. Heck, I could have used a little hot water and had delicious carrot and cucumber and anything-else-I-wanted soup...Inspired and greatly impressed, I went out and gathered a lot of the fabulous chickweed tops from my ""garden"" and made chickweed pesto with garlic, sunflower seeds, olive oil and Parmesan... Astounding, magnificent, awesome.....Then, from Bryan Au's ""Raw in Ten Minutes""??<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Raw-Food-In-Ten-Minutes-How-to-make-the-best-Raw-Organic-Meals-in-just-10-Minutes/dp/1434822540/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raw Food In Ten Minutes: How to make the best Raw Organic Meals in just 10 Minutes!</a>, I started with a quarter cup of water and made Pine nut, EVOO, turmeric and miso ""cheese"" and drizzled it over (potato peeler thin) slices of olive oil marinated raw yams... quite simply out-of-this-world amazing raw Mac and Cheese... and in just a very few minutes...Cleanup could not be easier.  Just rinse out the container and you are good to go. It's just that easy. No meticulous, laborious cleaning of all the parts, nooks and crannies found in other appliances like the GS-3000 juicer??<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Tribest-Green-Star-Juicer-GS-3000/dp/B000E4C596/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tribest Green Star Juicer GS-3000</a>??I use for green-leafy and wheatgrass juicing. The GS-3000 is still the best for high-quality wheatgrass juice but now I'll be getting all my fruit and vegetable juices plus the finely pulverized fiber, leaves, stems and seeds of the entire plant and all of it tastes unbelievably alive and delicious...So, finally, this evening, elated after many joyous gastronomic experiments and culinary peak experiences, I sit here quite sated and completely satisfied. Enough so that I felt compelled to write this review. This blender has opened up infinite possibilities for creation of silky smooth preparations of fruits, nuts, berries and veggies all automatically blended to perfection in my Blendtec blender. I was a skeptic, and I certainly had my doubts, but now I'm a true believer...I guess I could go on and on trying to explain what it felt like to experience all the exquisite flavors, creamy textures and high-tech capabilities of my Blendtec HP3A blender but that would be like standing on the back of a whale fishing for minnows. If you are into raw food preparation the Blendtec HP3A is an immensely powerful machine that will swing wide open the gates to a more vital and healthy world in ways you cannot possibly imagine, but will quite thoroughly enjoy.",104

It has different settings, depending on what you want to make.  Crushes ice with ease.  Great for milk shakes.  Great for smoothies.  If it is able to be blended, this blender can do it!  See the company's ""Will it Blend?"" videos for some hilarious examples of that! :)..My only complaint about this blender is the noise.  It is very loud.  Perhaps that is part of having something so powerful?  Scares the cat when I turn it on, even after two years of use! :)",2

I can?€?t bring myself to just buy a KitchenAide (which I previously had) or a Vitamix because I just dropped $300 (on sale) on the BlendTec..The one and only positive is the motor. The negative is the jar is so poorly designed that there is effectively zero suction to create a vortex to pull frozen food into the blades (even when following the stacking instructions in the manual).  I have to choose between a smoothie that is liquid (Naked Juice consistency) or use a spoon to push frozen fruit into blades.  When I do get one that is a good consistency there are always chunks in it that didn?€?t get blended (tolerable when it is a chunk of mango, not so much when it is a junk of kale)..I would describe this blender as a $39 blender but with a powerful motor.",1

5,better than vita mix,29-Sep-10,No,"I bought my blendtec at costco. They had a special demo of the it a couple of weeks ago. It has an extended warranty of 7 years.  Since then we have used it daily and just love it. It does everything the vita-mix does. But fits on the counter under the cabinets. Its the same height as a regular blender. The best thing about these machines is the ease in cleaning. just add water a squirt of soap, blend a few seconds and rinse. No scrubbing of parts that takes an extra 10/15 minutes.",3
5,Amazing Blending Power,20-Aug-13,No,"I make a lot of shakes and this is the first blender that leaves no chunks behind. Not a single piece of ice, fruits, or vegetables. The recipes that come with this machine are awesome. This is by far the best blender I have ever owned, and the most expensive. But it is so well worth it.",0
5,Best service ever,30-May-13,No,We lost one of the rubber pads that fit on the bottom of the blender. I called customer service and the next day we receive not only the part we needed but some free samples of smoothies. The blender is really good and so easy to clean. I would rate the blender one of the best and the service is fantastic.  Thank you Miranda! I would recommend this product to anyone.,2

5,The best blender ever!!!,10-Mar-12,No,I have been using this blender for approximately one year and this thing is amazing.it blends everything perfectly every time. The ease of clean up allows me to use it daily despite my busy schedule. I decided to try and incorporate more greens and fruits in my diet and I can accomplish this with just one simple push of a button and quick clean up. The blender is quite noisy but the results is worth  it. I would  highly recommend this blender.,2

1,Motor Died after 10 Days!!!,15-Aug-11,No,"Someone named Laura wrote a review saying her Blendtec quit after 10 smoothies, and that she guessed this was a fluke. Well, you're not the only one. I spent ??497 on a Blendtec Total Blender Extreme with one of the Wildside BPA free jugs from a UK distributor. 10 days, 10 smoothies, the motor died dramatically with a spark, smoke and tripped the breaker, turning off every outlet in the house! That's right folks, ??49.70 per smoothie! And to think I bought the thing to save on the smoothies I was buying!..Now I'm dealing with the whole headache of trying to get them to fix or replace it. I bought the blender in part because of all the youtube videos singing it's praises, but if you notice, Robyn O when she's comparing the Blendtec and Vitamix says that ""if you have a problem, Vitamix will fix your blender no questions asked."" She doesn't say the same about Blendtec, and there is a very god reason for this omission!..On the blender's performance, the whole idea behind the green smoothie is that you can get some greens into your diet without noticing them in your fruit smoothie. For me, on the higher powered of the 2 smoothie settings, I made a few green smoothies with a relatively minimal amount of kale (less than 1/6 of the smoothie), and I definitely noted the chunks of kale still in it. I honestly think you could and should do better.",88

5,Best Blender Ever!!!,24-Apr-10,No,"My hubby got this for me for our first anniversary. I love it. We looked at the vita mixer and after ready reviews that the vita mixer had all kinds of problems and would heat up too quickly we got the blendtec. It blends everything! And it doesnt heat anything up (unless you leave it running for like 5 minutes then it is suppost to do that)! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a high powered blender or food processer. It grinds everything we put in it, even nuts and seeds. The best part is its about $200 cheaper then the vita mixer and works 10x better!",0
5,Five Stars,5-Sep-16,No,"Love, love, love this blender.",1
2,Buy the Vitamix!,14-Jun-14,No,"So if you're used to a low-end blender and have never used a Vitamix, you'll be very impressed with what this blender can do.  But if you have used this alongside of a Vitamix, you'll come to hate this blender pretty quickly.  My mother-in-law has the Blendtec.  We hate it so much that we bring our Vitamix to her house on each extended visit, just so we won't have to deal with it.  However, on our last visit we had so much baby gear packed in our SUV that we didn't have room for the Vitamix to come along.  Darn it!  I had almost forgotten how LOUD the Blendtec is.  I actually used a decimeter on it and it is way in the red danger zone.  (You'd better use ear plugs for this thing.)..Also, this particular Blendtec is only a few years old and has seen very little use.  But on this last trip when we had to use it, it started saying ""overload"" on the display and won't keep running.  It isn't overloaded, it is just worn out already after no where near the amount of use it should be able to take.  It is no longer under warranty.  Our Vitamix is not only a lot quieter, it works much better without making a huge mess...and has seen way more action than the Blendtec for a lot longer...and it is still under warranty. The Vitamix is currently as good as new.  Also, with the control you have on the Vitamix, your smoothies don't end up being thrown to the bottom of the lid, making that much more mess to clean up.  On the Blendtec, I have to run the smoothie setting two or three times to get it blended to the degree the Vitamix can do in much less time.  And all the while everyone in the room is going deaf from the noise...Buy the Vitamix!  You'll be a lot happier.",4

3,Blendtec Twister Jar,20-Oct-13,No,"Just received new BlendTec Total Blender about three days ago.  Taking my time to following directions exactly..Smoothie yesterday: added ingredients in proper order into Twister Jar.  Small half carrot on top.  Big hunk of carrot left after blending..Smoothie today:  Cut carrot; it blended.  Forgot to use ginger so I added a thin (1/8"") slice and used ""Whole Juice"" setting again.  Had pieces of ginger in the jar after blending..Now the smoothie is warm; used ""Pulse"" also.  Didn't help...BIG PROBLEM:  No matter what I blend, the jar will actually FLY OFF THE BASE if I don't hold onto it.  And I am setting it on the base properly...I watched my friend use her Vitamix, and she had so much trouble getting ingredients out of the bottom.  The machine sat very tall and she had to reach way up.to us the tamper.  I have bad shoulders and this would never do for me...I'm going to call BlendTec tomorrow.  I just hate to send it back to Costco cuz I love the features, but if it doesn't do what they say. . .",2
2,My honest take on Blendtec vs Vitamix,3-Dec-13,No,"My partner and I were going to buy the Vitamix originally, but decided to buy the Blendtec instead after seeing it was $80 less (at Costco). Overall we were very unimpressed and did not feel like we were using a $300 blender. After using the blender for a few days then returning it for a Vitamix, I do not believe that the ""Blendtec vs VItamix"" debate is even a legitimate discussion; Vitamix is in a league of its own, and if the Blendtec is truly a $300 blender, the Vitamix feels like it should cost at least twice that...One of the first differences immediately noticeable between the two is the all-around build quality. The Vitamix's pitcher feels significantly higher-quality than the Blendtec's. The rubber handle is a nice touch, which the Blendtec does not offer. I also noticed that whenever I made smoothies with the Blendtec, the underside of the lid would be covered and dripping with smoothie material. WIth the Vitamix, this did not happen at all. It was annoying always needing to wash the lid so thoroughly with the Blendtec. The inside of the blendtec pitcher is a little bit easier to clean, but I don't really mind cleaning the Vitamix at all...The build quality differences extend to the entire machine. The base of the Vitamix feels much sturdier and seems to be built out of higher-quality plastics and workmanship. I didn't like the pre-set buttons on the Blendtec at all, even if one can find work-arounds that allow them more control like the Vitamix. The control and tamper of the Vitamix seems to be a huge advantage. One gets an intuitive feel of how to make smoothies and can address issues as they arise and end up whipping up perfect smoothies with ease...The biggest difference I noticed is the noise. I've seen reviews saying both machines are extremely loud, but to me the difference is extremely pronounced. The Blendtec seems at least 30% louder at the highest setting, but that's not even the full story. The Vitamix's sound, at every level, is deep and muffled sounding. Even at the highest setting, I feel one can stand directly next to it without any problem. Not so for the Blendtec --- the Blendtec's highest setting is *EXTREMELY* loud and very, very high-pitched. It was actually unpleasant and I had to cover my ears or leave the room. In another review, I heard someone say the Blendtec is like a leaf blower at full blast, while the Vitamix is like the gentle deep purr of a high-level sports car. I think this is a pretty good analogy if you are trying to imagine it...Lastly, before I go on for too long, I found that the smoothie quality was quite a bit better in the Vitamix, and that smoothies were made much more quickly. I'm willing to accept this was just because I didn't get used to the Blendtec, though, because most reviews I read seemed to find them pretty equal here. The Blendtec's pre-set ""Smoothie"" button runs the highest setting for 20-seconds. When I put spinach in the machine, my smoothie had a lot of little pieces. With the vitamix, I ran it on the low setting and it quickly, with only a gentle purr, broke everything up into small pieces. I pushed everything down with the tamper and ran it on the high setting for 5 to 10 seconds and my smoothie was one of the smoothest, creamiest things I've ever ingested. It was like discovering a new sensory experience - phenomenal...The way I see it, Vitamix is the head of the class. They've perfected the art of blending and no company is truly going to out-do them. Blendtec is obligatory ""competitor"" but it's actually not.",9

1,Dangerously loud,27-Aug-12,No,"We bought a new Blendtec in 2010. It failed after 18 months. It took Blendtec about a month to repair it under warranty. My wife thinks the blender works well. I am concerned about its noise level, which may be as high as 102 decibels. That's LOUD! In a work setting, such as a factory, the operator of that blender would be required to wear ear protection. The volume and kind of noise may be dangerous to one's hearing. Next time, we'll buy a quiet blender.",9
5,Unbelievable,10-Jan-09,No,"I don't know what's up with the first reviewer of this product, but it would appear that he/she should just stick with a single speed blender. This BlendTec is the most sophisticated, powerful and intuitive processing machine available. Somehow the reviewer did not read the manual (and with this level of sophistication you need to do so). I give it the highest rating for everything needing processing. You just need to learn how to use it.",11
2,"Garbage, get the Vitamix; read on to find out why I returned this..",23-Sep-12,No,"As I was browsing through the isles at Costco Wholesale one fine day, I came upon a Blendtec demonstrator. Instantly I was hooked with the awesome demos of smoothies, ice creams etc...Fast forward to the first time I put frozen strawberries in the machine to make smoothies and what happened? The machine rattles and moves around my counter violently. At this point, I was thinking ""ok it's not a big deal, I'll just hold it down with my hand. Next thing I know, the lid isn't able to stay shut during the blending cycle and parts of my smoothies are flying into the kitchen floor where my two dogs are eagerly waiting for whatever taste they can get...Furthermore, this blender has extremely high maintenance. The blade on the jar is not replaceable so you have to buy a whole new one from blendtec. The drive shaft doesn't seem to fit properly into the bottom of the jar and so it seems to grind away metal pieces from the ""teeth"" of the socket little by little (and this wasn't just an issue with my machine, read online and you will find that SO many people are having this problem; I think its just a design flaw)...Also, if this thing is 3hp while the Vitamix is 2, why does this blender ALWAYS leave chunks after a cycle? I always have to press and hold pulse for at least 15 more seconds to get it perfectly smooth. I had the Wildside jar so this should not be happening...Eventually, I got frustrated and went to Vitamix's website to find when the demo was coming to my local costco; luckily I only had to wait about a week. When I saw the demo at costco for the new models they sell (the 6300 which has automatic presets JUST like the blendtec) I was convinced that I don't need the blendtec anymore...The vitamix is solid for me now; no moving around, no grinding away teeth and its quieter as well. Vitamix customer service is literally unbeatable and will readily provide any spare parts should u need them...Save yourself the trouble, spend a little bit more and get the vitamix; you won't regret it.",4
1,Don't expect it to last long,15-Feb-11,No,"Within a short amount of time the Blendtec all of a sudden became super, super loud! I'm not kidding when I say it was as loud as a lawn mower! We have a hunting dog who's used to loud noise and it doesn't bother him. However, turn this thing on and he runs away scared. If you stand in front of it (or within 30 feet) you'd literally have to use ear plugs, and family members would roll their eyes and walk away using their fingers to plug their ears...Meanwhile, the black plastic seal below the blade would fall apart - shredding and melt with use. Yes I said melt (due to the high velocity blades) this plastic turned to liquid and would cover the bottom of the container and top of the base. It was hard to clean too, you couldn't just rinse or even scrub it all off! Very nasty and we wondered if any of it was getting into our smoothies...Also, it came with a recipe book so we tried one of the soups. It tasted very nasty, did they even test these recipes?..Bottom line: I had a Vitamix which gave me 10 years of good service so am going back to that brand. The good news is that we bought the Blendtec at Costco which came with a 7 year warranty. We returned it without the original box and with the melted black plastic stuck on it and they gave us a full cash refund no questions asked. Buyer beware.",107

That's a big reason I purchased it.  Didn't work well for that.  Okay if you ate it just after making it, but it turned to ice after you froze it, and didn't taste good after that.  I thought the quality of the blender was excellent.  It just didn't do all that it promised.",1
1,Make sure the appliance is valid for your country,6-Mar-12,Yes,"I was looking forward to my Blendtec blender.  I live in Australia, but when I received it, the appliance had an American plug and had American voltage, which is not suitable for Australian grid.  Just to say to other buyers beware of buying electrical goods in US - make sure they comply with your country.  I had to send blender back to Amazon, but was still stung for the postage which I think they should have paid for.  I am still waiting for my refund.",4

2,Looks nice but......,20-Apr-15,No,"I was in the market for a new blender.  The choice was Vitamix or Blendtec.  I went with Blendtec because it was cheaper and looked so much better.  I loved the sleek body style and the touch screen.  And, after all, I had seen the Will It Blend Videos.  It may blend cell phones, rakes and golf balls but it did not do a good job on my smoothies... I was disappointed from day 1.  The blender violently shook and moved across the counter while making a smoothie.  The blender was loaded per the instructions.  The presets did not work well.  Apparently my smoothies need more than 40 seconds.  The lid popped off several times while it was running, even though it was secure all around.  So much for setting it and walking away.  When the lid was not popping off, there was more smoothie on the lid than in the jar.  Guess the lid liked smoothies too.  On the 87th day, the keypad on the Designer Series decided that I was pressing multiple buttons at a time.  It repeatedly gave me the error message that multiple buttons were pressed.  Never figured out which button that was.  After 3 hours on hold waiting for customer service, I get a condescending representative.  When the questions from her script did not produce the answers she was looking for, she suggested that my keypad was dirty and that's why it thought I was pushing more than one button.  Really?  That's the best you can do after 3 hours?..After much discussion, the representative agreed to refund my money.  Oh she put up a fight, but so did I.  I expected a lot more out of this blender.  Perhaps if I was blending iPhones and golf balls, it would have done better.  I learned several things about a Blendtec.  I have learned that having a 3 hp motor does not mean you will get a great blend.  I have learned that you want a top that snaps on and locks into place.  I have learned that a tamper is not a bad thing.  Blendtec has one, it's called the Twister Jar, which worked very well when I made peanut butter.  But the most important thing I learned, cough up the extra money for the Vitamx, especially if that's what you really want anyway.  I now have a Vitamix and am very happy.  The Blendtec may be a good machine, but it did not work for me.  For those that have one and love it, I am happy for you.  I wish I had your experience.",3

2,Deafening and over-priced...,22-Feb-14,No,"Every time I run this thing, it sounds like I'm driving a motorcycle around in our apartment. They say you can make soup in it. By the time it heated it up, you would have a headache and be hard of hearing. Blenders are all loud, but they don't need to be THIS loud. I've used a Vitamix; it's not even half as loud. The container's seal recently just gave out on me as well, blowing black rubber shards into my salsa. I was only using it for soft fruit smoothies and salsas -- not crushing ice or making bread dough like they suggest that you can do. Solution: pay more for another container... As if $400 isn't enough for a blender anyhow. If you are going to spend a lot on a blender, I would not recommend this. I want my money back. I could have bought/broken 20 normal blenders for this amount of money. Will it blend your pocketbook? Yes.",2

Ended up returning and getting the Vitamix. Which brings me to.......If you are going between the Blendtec and VItamix like I was, go for the Vitamix and don't waste your time or money on the Blendtec! There literally is no comparison between the two. Every smoothie and sorbet turns out PERFECT in the Vitamix, no issues with the motor, simply delicious perfection! It is soooooo dreamy.

4,An excellent blender with many purposes,18-Jan-08,No,"I have owned this blender for about a month. So far it has worked great. It is a great tool to have if you expect to blend stuff on a daily basis.  The larger blades and powerful motor makes my Oyster beehive blender feel like a toy. It will blend things that conventional blenders would not even begin to blend. Baby food can be puree very well. Much better than with the food processor. This machine can basically replace a food processor, a juicer, and a grinder...Things I like:.1. It blends just about anything do to the large blades and powerful 1500 watt motor. And it does it much faster than a conventional blender..2. It's built in the USA and the parts seem to be good quality..3. One push button operation  allows you to blend w/o having to time it or supervise it..4. lifetime warranty on coupling and blade..5. It fits under standard counters...Things I do not like:.1. The base has a cheap feel to it because of the plastic. For the price, I think it should have been metal..2. Has lesser warranty than its competitor (Vita-Mix)..3. I expect an expensive tool like this to have better dampening to absorb noise and vibration..4. The plastic container (polycarbonate) scratches easily when mixing grains, seeds, etc.",482

I realized that I feared the blade would hit me next time while in motion..After realizing I WAS AFRAID OF THIS KITCHEN APPLIANCE, I contacted customer service and spoke to multiple representatives and the manager, Grant. I received questions and comments such as ""I've never seen this before"" and ""What were you blending?"" To answer that question, I was blending 8oz soy milk, 1banana, and frozen blueberries..Grant told me he would contact me within 24 hours and he never did. I called and left a message 4 days later and no response. I then called after 1 week and a customer service representative apologized and told me to return it to Costco. When I asked, ""Why did Grant not tell me this over 1 week ago?"" She apologized profusely and that was that. Bottom Line: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT IS DANGEROUS***and not to mention the customer service is less than helpful!",10

1,I purchased the Blendtec blender thinking it was good with all of good reviews,25-Sep-14,No,"I purchased the Blendtec blender thinking it was good with all of good reviews. I was disappointed. Just a few uses, the blender made noise. The gear drive in the jar came lose. Then the jar started to leak.  This was really bad and did not worth for the money. I do not recommend to anyone.",2

1,Died after 1 day,10-Jan-11,No,"I cannot believe it! I purchased this blender from costco yesterday, used it 10 times so far and this morning while making a smoothie it completely died. I do believe it was a fluke, though. But I just want to make sure I logged this in case it happens to anyone else. I am going to get a new one from costco today but if it happens again I will definitely switch to the vitamix.",34
1,Not At All Happy,2-Apr-10,No,"I purchased a Blendtec 2 months ago.  It does a good job on smoothies, no doubt about it.  But for $400 I expected a much more versatile product. This machine has ONLY preset buttons, so if you want to blend something for, say, one minute and 10 seconds, you cannot.  You have to use their preset cycle, which will shut off after a specified time which you cannot change.  You have to stand right next to the machine and start it up again.  This is incredibly frustrating.  With my old really cheap $15 blender, I could turn it on to ""puree"", set the stopwatch, and go do something else.  With the Blendtec, if you are not following their recipe, you cannot do this.  Stupid.  If I had known about this limitation, I would have never have this machine.  There is only a 30 day warranty, so I am out of luck.  Anyone want to buy mine?",46

1,If It Sounds Too Good To Be True....,24-Nov-07,No,"I was looking for a heavy duty blender, when I got over the sticker shock I did my homework.  After searching many online sites and reading many reviews I decided to purchase the Blendtec rather than the Vitamix.  After six months of simple use for making smoothies with frozen berries the machine broke down.  It would spin out of control and then shut down in overload.  Customer service took my information and assured me a rush repair and return.  That was two weeks ago. First they said they never received it and had never heard of me, fortunately I had Fed Ex confirm they had signed for it.  Last week they said it was going out expedited shipping, not here yet. My review is that this machine is too expensive to break down after such minor use.  Understanding that there may have been a faulty part, the customer service is non existent.  From ""who are you"", ""we never got the machine"", to ""It's in the mail"".  Check out reviews for Vitamix and its customer service rating. This was too good to be true, let the buyer beware of Blendtec.",146

1,"Very poor blender, in almost every way",3-Nov-08,No,"This blender is the worst blender I have ever tried, and I'm stuck with it because the seller doesn't take them back...I will post videos of the miserable failure of this blender to mix anything but pampered preparations of ingredients, and by pampered I mean cut and manipulated so that this blender will grab them and mix them...It is just horrible at blending fruits and vegetables, as the blade design leaves things just sitting there.  Put an apple in one and just turn it on.  It won't blend it a bit.  Put apple quarters and a banana in and it won't blend it a bit.  $100 blenders will, but this one won't most of the time...Add to this three other problems, and you have a horrible product for the price.  I'm not kidding.  I wanted this to work, having paid so much...Lid design is very poor.  You can't take it off without disturbing the blender so much that it comes off the axle...Startup is an out-of-control, gushing pulse that will send liquids out the top every time.  So, if you blend some ingredients and want to then put other ingredients in while it is stirring, you will have to put the top on to get the thing going before you remove it again and add ingredients...The shape of the blender vessel creates vortices which spill liquids out the top at even the lowest speeds.  Adding ingredients to a mix will most of the time lead to spillage on your shirt, arms and countertop...The 50-second timed shutoff is a nuisance.  You might be adding ingredients to a blended mix and have to RESTART to finish, and restarting means dealing with the horrible startup pulse...In general, this blender will not blend raw fruits and vegetables without you adding liquids that you might not want and stopping to push and minipulate the contents so that they blend...This blender seems to be missing all the elements that a well-thought-out $400 product should offer.  I use a $100 blender to do all the work I hoped this one would do.",36
1,One Star,18-Jan-15,No,Pffffffft!!! Should have bought a Vitamix instead. This blender sucks,2
4,Vitamix vs Blendtec,23-Jul-11,No,"I have owned a Vitamix for over 2 years. My daughter has owned a Blendtec for the same period of time. We call this ""Blender wars"", as we both love our blenders. But here are the differences we see between the two...1. Warranty. The Vitamix definitely has the better warranty. We purchased ours at Costco, so this is a non-issue. Costco will honor any purchase, regardless of warranty..2. Horsepower. The Blendtec has a 3 hp motor, the Vitamix a 2hp. But we don't see any difference whatsoever in the blended results. Vitamix told me they achieve a similar result due to the design &amp; movement of the blades..3. Tamper. The Blendtec's 3 hp will usually blend everything without any pushing. The Vitamix requires use of the tamper if you blend things like frozen fruits, apples, etc. This requires you to stand there for about 30 seconds longer, or less, to use the tamper..4. Lid. The Vitamix has the better lid. It never pops off, as the Blendtec lid will if not held down at first. And the Vitamix lid has a large hole, where the tamper fits through, or a cap fits in securely, where you can add ingredients without removing the lid. The Blendtec has a tiny hole for ventilation, through which liquids squirt upward..5. Container. The Blendtec has the better container. It has flat sides, which are easy to clean of the finished drink, or thick nut butters, etc. The Vitamix container has an uneven surface, which is hard to get finished products entirely off of..6. Cleaning. Both Vitamix &amp; Blendtec clean easily. Add water &amp; detergent, blend for a few seconds, rinse..7. Noise. Both are very loud. Very. I put mine on a rubber mat to reduce the noise..8. The Vitamix looks more sturdy, more expensive. It's a little heavier, which makes the Blendtec preferred for travel..9. The Vitamix controls are variable. The Blendtec has programmable buttons. If I need a smoothie to run for 2 minutes, I have to look at the clock, or set my timer on the microwave. My daughter can just push a button, and know how many seconds it will run, then stop..10. Owner's manual. We agree hands down that the Vitamix has the better manual. 3 ring binder, tabs for categories, extra books for grains, etc, with holes already punched. The Blendtec manual is pathetic. You need a good book while getting acquainted with your blender..11. The Vitamix is taller than the Blendtec. I put my base on the countertop, the container on the fridge. My daughter can put her entire unit on the countertop..12. Vitamix recipes really deliver great results. I like to eat healthier, so I easily modify them. My daughter has taken tips from the Vitamix manual. The Vitamix has been around for decades, so they already know how to get the best results from their blender. The Blendtec really needs to work on their recipes..13. Flour. I had to buy a second ""dry"" container($100) to blend my flours with the Vitamix. The Blendtec will blend flours in the original container. My daughter has to plan to blend flour first thing in the morning, when her container is dry...Both my daughter and I have used our blenders at least once a day, sometimes several times a day, for over 2 years. We can't imagine being without them. We make our own flours, soups, smoothies, nut butters, seed milks, you name it. She made her own coconut wraps last night, using real coconut blended with other ingredients, then layered the mush onto parchment paper, dehydrated for 4 hours, and made samosas with plum chutney. The wraps took her minutes to prepare, using the Blendtec and dehydrator, not counting the 4 hours wait time. Salsas and chutneys take seconds. If we use frozen fruits for our ice creams, blending for about 20 seconds, we don't need to use an ice cream maker afterward. Puddings are a dream. No standing over a hot stove, stirring. I use raw, unsalted pumpkin seeds for the milk, flax meal for the egg substitute, cacao nibs for the chocolate. No one knows the difference, except that mine is the best pudding in town...I like good appliances, that make eating healthy really easy and fast. Whether you choose a Vitamix or a Blendtec, you can eat healthier at home, without having to work hard at it when you are tired after work. No more fast food restaurants! I'm finishing the last of my smoothie(spinach, apple, cucumber, ginger, mint leaves, bee pollen). Yum. Maybe a lentil curry soup for dinner. I already made my bread(homemade whole wheat &amp; rye flours)...You have to USE YOUR BLENDER! A friend purchased the Blendtec 7 months ago, and hasn't touched it. This may be due to lack of a good owner's manual. The Vitamix manual is available through Amazon, called Whole Food Recipes for Better Living. This has really good tasting recipes to get you started, but may not be the healthiest. It really shows you how to use the blender, after which you can easily modify the recipes. I also like Going Raw, Everything you need...","2,797"
1,Motor burning out from the very beginning!,26-Jul-16,Yes,"We bought this blender in October 26,  2011.  On the first use it smelled like burning rubber or plastic.  We contacted Amazon and they switched it out.  We used our new one a few sporadic times, and it started to do the same thing.  We contacted Blendtec under the warranty and they ""repaired"" it.  We have used this blender about 30-40  times total in the last 5 years  and again it smells like burning plastic.  Tonight we even saw visible smoke coming out of the base...We have only done smoothies and shakes in this machine, and due to these issues, it has been a major disappointment!  We follow the liquid on the bottom rule every time, and it still seems to be burning out.  We unplug it between every use, and follow every rule we can think of...For the price this should be a daily use machine, for 20 years.  The quality has fallen very short of this mark!  We would not recommend this blender to anyone!",43
5,I LOVE ice cream,27-Jan-18,Yes,"GUILT FREE...purchase,  and the ice cream I make EVERY NIGHT.  Long story short,  in 11 months I burnt up 4 blenders,  Oster, black n decker,  Hamilton beach and....YES a VITA-MIX.  i aquired a ninja with so many cups, pitchers, blades,  processor,  pieces.... no match for the task.  I LOVE ice cream... lo carb,  cashew milk and ice.... assortment of flavors added....So I NEEDED power, durability, and LONGEVITY.  so for 3 months, many sites and research,  warranties, power, parts, reviews, i narrowed my search Vitamix and Blendtec..... reviews, online demo videos,  simplicity in design,  POWER, AND FANTASTIC WARRANTY....no brainer.  BLENDTEC CLASSIC  with wildside pitcher IS  FAR SUPERIOR to anything i have tried or read about.  It devours ice and all the ingredients  .... like cookie monster at a Keebler cookie factory.  I look forward to using it for all my culinary needs, and SOUP....mmmm.  oh and if your wondering about seeds,  ie: raspberry, blueberry,  raw vanilla bean..... obliterated them.  So THANK YOU BLENDTEC.  To ALL... buy, use, enjoy.",28
1,Motor is great and it?€?s a powerful blender but the overpriced jar ...,11-Feb-18,Yes,"Motor is great and it?€?s a powerful blender but the overpriced jar with the fixed blade is garbage. The seals that keep the blade bearings lubricated will quickly wear out and you?€?ll here a grinding noise when using it. You?€?ll see grease splattered on the underside of the jar. Replacement is $89-$120. This picture is after just one year of use, never put in the dishwasher.",12
5,"I love it, and have from day 1",21-Dec-15,Yes,"I love it, and have from day 1. I purposely held off writing the review until I could really put it through its paces. 6 years, and 1000+ uses later, this beast is still going strong. Primary use: smoothies (probably 80-85% of what I use it for). Secondary uses: grinding flours &amp; spices, whole fruit/vegetable juicing, crushing ice, blending soups, powdering sugar. I recommend a second jar specifically for dry goods- certain things can pit and cloud your jar up. Do you or a family member hate greens but feel like they should probably find a way to like them? Use this. No more chewing your kale..The eternal Vita-mix vs Blendtec argument appears as though it will rage on longer than any individual will be alive to see the end of it, but all you need to know is this: you're not going to go wrong with either machine. I prefer the Blendtec for my needs because of the duller blades &amp; design (easier and safer to clean out), and it handles dry goods a bit better, but these machines are both champs. If there's a third party in that league, I don't know it. The killer consumer blender segment is a duopoly in my book, and the Blendtec earned its seat at the table.",13
3,I wasn't really happy with that,17-Apr-16,Yes,"I bought my Blendtec 3 or 4  years ago.  I didn't use it very much.  I made vegi smoothies. Then fruit smoothies. But not on a daily basis, or weekly basis.  I used frozen fruit with non-frozen foods, always cut up, I didn't use ice, just the frozen fruit and not frozen kale, lettuce, etc.  I noticed that the plastic part of the blade that would slide into the metal bottom, started wearing out.  It didn't connect all the time. I would take a spoon and mix up the fruit and liquid so that the blender wouldn't have to work so hard.  Well, it didn't make it.  It spun itself out, and rubber entered my smoothie and spread it all over my counter top, smoked it at the same time..I wasn't really happy with that. My daughter was the one that said Mom you really need one of these.  Ok, $545.00  later, for a machine that wasn't used on a daily, weekly basis.  I can't afford another Blentec.  I am going to see if they replacement parts for that?? I am very unhappy because I don't know if I can afford any replacement parts. I was expecting that this Blentec would have lasted longer that 3 years.  I don't want to buy another blender, like Oster, or Hamilton Beach, etc..I guess I would say get the 5 year replacement plan.  I was happy until it went bye bye!!! I need a smoothie bad, my grandson isn't happy about it either. He always knew I had smoothie in the frig.  Easy for him to run in and get a good meal from that smoothie. Wish me luck:(",8
5,Why buy anything else?,4-Jun-14,Yes,"Bought this blender 5 years ago and because it comes with a built-in counter of blend cycles, my family and I have used the machine exactly 1267 times.  I just now called Blendtec because the blade in the jar has finally become loose and is causing loud, inefficient blends, needs to be replaced.  The whole blender, apparently including the jar, is warranted for 7 years.  Blendtec is sending me a new jar at no cost, didn't have to show any proof of the problem or return the worn jar or anything.  The customer service rep even seemed concerned that there wasn't anything else wrong with the blender that might need replacing/repairing, because she had me run the blender through a cycle without the jar to make sure the motor was running smoothly.  It was.  Great customer service!!..About the blender itself;  it's flawless!  We use it for everything from smoothies, to whole fruit/vegetable juices, to margaritas, to making fresh peanut and other nut butters, to grinding grain into flour, to salsas, and anything else one would use a blender, ice crusher, smoothie maker, grinder, food processor for.  The smoothies come out perfect, everything does.  You know, store bought peanut butter has additives that aren't necessary, such as palm oil (to make it thick and not oily - more solidified), salt, preservatives.  And just like everything else you make with the blender, you know exactly what's in the smoothies, etc.  So you can eat as healthy as you want...Granted the cost of this blender is high, but you really do get what you pay for.  After going through about 5-6 ""traditional"" (for lack of a better word) household blenders and other devices (I actually bought a blender specifically designed for making only smoothies - what a waste of money) including Oster, GE, etc over the years, which all lacked the power to do anything other than mixing (blending?)liquids, I finally decided it might be worth it to fork over the cash for something that might be able to do what I needed - quick, well blended, ""smooth"" smoothies any way I want 'em, and the ultimate frozen margaritas.  This blender does way more.  Just like the u-tube commercials show, this thing will literally ""blend"" anything.  Highly recommend it!!",29
5,Great item,2-Dec-17,Yes,"Just received mine so it?€?s early in its use but I did want to comment on the noise that folks say is loud- I used mine today for the first time and was expecting it to be louder than my previous Oster and Nutribullet RX and can say the Blendtec is QUIETER than each of those products! So much less noise and such a shorter usage is needed.  I am beyond thrilled and can say clean up was a breeze.  I am quite pleased to have gotten such a great Cyber Monday deal and with an 8 yr warranty, feel even without the deal, the price is worth it. My kitchen is complete now!..Fits under my counter with ease too!",5
5,"Quiet, powerful, and easy to clean",1-Jul-18,Yes,"I owned an older Vitamix for years and I hardly ever used it because it was too big to make food for one person. I got the Blendtec on the Treasure Truck (hooray for the Truck!!!) and I can't say enough good things about it. The motor is more powerful and it's incredibly quiet compared to any other blender I've used (and I've used them all). For me, the best part is that it came with a smaller jar that has a normal lid as well as an extra lid with long twisting arms that reach down the sides to help you remove stickier blends like nut butters and hummus. I use that blender almost every day for smoothies, dressings, hummus, gazpacho...you name it. I don't eat animal products, so making things like cashew cream and non-dairy dressings are part of my weekend food prep and the Blendtec makes it so much more manageable. It cleans up easily too. I love this blender!",2
1,It?€?s not making smoothies - maybe it?€?s fake?,12-Jun-18,Yes,I have been attempting to make smoothies using frozen strawberries and apple juice etc. the machine won?€?t do it! I have to use a spoon to keep moving things around etc and it takes at least 10 minutes :( not sure if this is a fake Blendtec or what?,6
5,"Powerful, strudily built and durable.",3-Aug-14,Yes,"For the last 30 years, at least, I have been on an endless quest to find a durable ice crusher.  I've used and destroyed six Metrocane crushers, two electric machines (different brands but almost identical construction), plus several others, manual and electric.  I despaired of ever finding a usable and sturdily built machine.  I first saw this Blendtec on a NatGeo program.  It works perfectly and dependably.  According to the running count on the backlit LCD readout, I've used it a bit more than 200 times.  There's no sign of wear or imminent failure.  Actually, I wanted a crusher that would make chunky, convenience-store sort of ice.  On the slowest speed, this Blendtec will turn a 16-oz tray of ice, fresh from the freezer, into snow in less than 10 seconds. Before I turn it on, I add enough Coca-Cola to make a full liter.  Ten seconds later, I've got a perfect Slushee.  I love this machine.",11
4,"Works great - well, for the first 6 months.",9-May-18,Yes,"Literally blends through everything we've put in it (ice, frozen fruit, etc) with ease and quickly. However, after 6 months of use (about 100 cycles) it stopped working. Through an ""overload"" message and wouldn't blend. When spending this much on a blender, I would've thought it would last longer. To be fair, they are replacing it at no cost - but I think it's a reconditioned version. Hopefully that one lasts longer.",3
3,"Wish I could say I love this, and maybe it will come in time",31-Jul-18,Yes,"Wish I could say I love this, and maybe it will come in time, but right now I don't. I was so excited to order and receive this and was thinking it was going to blow away my $20 blender. And the first time I used it, it hardly moved. I mean barely spun. I've used it about 10 more times and while it spins fine, it leaves unmixed residue in the jar, and I've made smoothies with frozen broccoli where there is lumpy broccoli, which my $20 blender would have given me. It also left whole blackberry seeds intact and on the jar, which to me says they're not getting ground. For as much as these things cost, it should be fabulous. I toyed with getting a Vitamix instead but a mechanical engineer friend of mine convinced me I had to go with blendtec, and now I'm sorry I did. Perhaps as I use it more and use a variety of settings for smoothies, rather than just the smoothie setting, things will improve, but as it stands now I'm underwhelmed.",1
1,A good blender for 6 months...,24-Jul-18,Yes,"after 50 uses (there is a meter on the front), it stopped working with over temperature written on the display, 6 months after I bought my blender. I called Blendtec and they send me a refurbished base. For the price and use, I am very unhappy with the quality. The few times I used it it worked very well...",4
1,Expensive bender broke and company is ignoring me!,5-May-16,Yes,"I paid a small fortune for this blender and after less than 20 uses, a black rubbery substance from the bottom broke up and went into me shake! The smell was awful and lingered in my kitchen for hours. This blender is supposed to last for 15 years at the very least! Amazon has called and e-mailed them and the company has ignored me. So disappointed and upset!!",112
1,Motor or electronics issue,5-Aug-18,Yes,"Worked for about a week for smoothies, then I kept getting an error that the motor was overloaded, even if it barely had anything loaded. Restarting several times, unplugging, leaving it unplugged for a day did not help.",5
5,Best Blender Ever!,1-May-18,Yes,"I bought this blender two weeks ago and have used it over 30 times! From frapps to slushees, this thing can blend. I had a healthmaster blender by Montel williams and the thing was bulky and didn?€?t blend all that great. This thing breaks down seeds and ice like a champ. I had originally wanted a vitamix but after watching YouTube videos of them side by side, there wasn?€?t much of a difference. This is by far one of my favorite purchases! I try to find any reason now to blend something because I am literally still amazed at how well this machine does. It?€?s not huge or heavy but it sure is heavy duty and gets he job done. The 7 year warranty gives me peace of mind as it says that this company stands behind its product. I recommend this blender to anybody looking. What a great price!",1
5,Power and durability! Built to last!,17-Jan-18,Yes,"Will it Blend? Yes it will! These blender's have the power to blend nearly anything! Don't believe me? Visit the Youtube channel ""Will it Blend?"". I have always wanted one of these and scored this one for a little less than half price on a Cyber Monday deal. Normally this model is around 400 dollars and I scored it for about 190 dollars out the door! (I actually would have paid the 400 dollars for this blender but caught this deal at the right place at the right time.) I highly recommend the classic model. The only downside, It is louder than your normal household blender but it has all of the power and features that you would find in a commercial blender. Blendtec blenders rank very high in the commercial blender world and are also backed by an 8 year warranty. If you want a very well constructed and HIGHLY DURABLE blender that will last on your kitchen counter for many years to come, Blendtec is a very good choice to make! It will definitely blend whatever you throw at it in a household kitchen environment, and then some! This blender will surely blow away pretty much all of the household grade blenders that you will find on the shelf of your local box store and will most likely be the last blender that you will need to buy EVER! Definitely worth paying the extra money for the quality of the product!",2
5,I'm going to open up a Juice Bar in my Apartment for all my neighbors!,28-Oct-15,Yes,"Okay, so this has been sitting in my kitchen, in its box for a few years now. My mother has the exact same one and always makes me smoothies anytime I visit. I've been juicing (with extra greens) with the seasonal change and decided to break this bad boy out. Needless to say, I feel like I walked out of a Juice Bar store with the overall smoothie quality I achieved. EXCITING PART - I dumped in a few ice cubes and the blender actually sped up on its own. HELLO, technology for the win!!! Needless to say, my old blender, who has served me faithfully for over 5 years is now collecting dust in my kitchen.",4
5,If you like power tools...,17-Mar-12,Yes,"Blenctec vs VitaMix, that's the question..After much research I chose the BlendTec and have no regrets..Save your time, here is what you need to know....They are both incredible machines. It's like comparing 2 race cars. After all of my research, it seems to come down to the following:.1. The VitaMix is so large that it causes problems, i.e. not being able to store it on a counter if there is a cabinet..2. The shape of the VitaMix makes it difficult to get the rest of the smoothies out of the bottom and the side grooves...PERFORMANCE.The Blendtec is amazing..I put in my ingredients (i.e. coconut milk, wheat grass, bananas, blueberries, acai, agave, pumpkin seeds, chia) and hit ""Smoothie"" and it has  a preprogrammed cycle that it goes through with different power settings designed to make the perfect smoothie, juice, etc.. I make smoothies every day and the upgrade in the quality of the smoothie is tremendous. It is smoother, better blended, trust me, it's just a substantial difference...POWER.Yeah, it's just fun. It feels like you're using a power tool. Although it's loud, it's not really much louder than my old blender. Seems like they take care to minimize noise. Regardless, the power is FUN. Oh, and its fun to clean. THey recommend a drop of soap and a cup of water, put on the lid and hit PULSE for 5 seconds. Cool...OUT OF THE BOX.There is the blender, lid, instructions, a great recipe book and a dvd. Dvd is cool because they show people actually making a variety of recipes. It inspired me to do things other than smoothies, like pesto...DON'T LIKE.Personally, the ""Will it blend"" videos are obnoxious to me. I recycle everything I can and do my best to be a responsible consumer, to be green, to ne conscious. Blending all this stuff seems wasteful and unnecessary. The product speaks for itself already. They should take that time to make great videos about real people making real food.",15
5,A Pleasure to Use,1-Feb-18,Yes,There are a lot of options on this machine and it is easy to clean because of the big blade. It is not like some that have a small pointy blade that you have to poke around to clean up.,3
5,Grinds Avocado Pits AND Froths Milk!,1-Oct-11,Yes,"This blender is powerful and versatile. I've had it for a couple of years and, at first, it just sat there. The recipes that accompany the blender are completely uninspiring, but I purchased it to produce whole food smoothies from Jeff Primack's Smoothie Formulas. After taking his Food Healing course a year later I really got into the smoothies and am now convinced that no ordinary blender would hold up to the job. It grinds avocado pits and other ingredients into a healthy and good-tasting drink. No one would even guess there was an avocado pit in it! I've been making daily smoothies for several months and the blender is working well. Note: Before purchasing the Blendtec, I did try making the whole food smoothies in an old Vitamix blender but it couldn't handle the avocado pit. These recipes require a 3 horsepower blender...really!..Yes, it is expensive, but it just saved me $90 for a fancy cappuccino milk frother. On a hunch, I tried placing one cup of whole milk in the Blendtec and ran four 50 second cycles while I made an espresso shot with the AeroPress Coffee/Espresso Maker. By the time the espresso was done the Blendtec had produced a cup of steaming hot milk with a good head of foam. The mug of cappuccino was hot for a good 30 minutes and there was foam left at the bottom of the cup as I drained it. Fantastic! I will be looking for other ways to turn the Blendtec into a multitasker. In fact, I ordered an extra blender jar to maximize its potential...All in all, the Blendtec is an excellent product. It is a bit noisy, but fits under the counter. The square jar is somewhat difficult to clean, but is dishwasher safe.  It would be better with an on/off switch for the heat for those times you want a cold smoothie without adding ice...Customer service is excellent. They sent out a replacement blender no questions asked within the first month. It was my fault as I had forgotten the on/of switch which is hidden on the back.of the unit. Highly recommended.",11
4,"Great blend, but you will probably need to put that warranty to work at some point.",12-Apr-18,Yes,"It is the same type of blender I used at my old job, Panera.  These blenders are amazing.  Between me and my Boyfriend, we have put 98 blends on it in maybe 5 months.  I liquefies and purees like it's going out of style.  My only complaint is ""gunk"" is getting stuck/slowly leaking out of the blenders bottom where the blend prongs are attached.  All I can say is thank goodness for the seven year warranty on the thing...On another note, I don't think these are brand new, never used.  Mine looked like it had been used and rolled in dirt.  (Maybe check out Blentec.com for something you know will be legit)  The quality of products on Amazon is starting to freak me out a little.",1
5,Yes it's amazing. Yes you should buy one.,20-Nov-15,Yes,"I was a little iffy at the $400 price-tag initially, but after using it for over a year now I can say with confidence I've already got my money's worth. After using cheap blenders that can barely blend a fruit smoothie and break after a couple months, I was ready to try a real blender. I was considering vitamix or ninja, but I figured that the blendtec jar is the easiest to clean so I went with this one. I make smoothies, juice, salsa, pasta sauce, waffle-mix (oh my god it's so easy compared to the old method of whipping it by hand), soup, milkshakes, and all sorts of other stuff. I don't like spending more than I have to, and this blender was worth every penny.",3
1,"Stopped working after a few days with ""Overload"" error.",22-Apr-18,Yes,"I got this off the treasure truck. Used it for a few days and the blender stopped working completely. The blender just says ""Overload"" in any mode I try. I tried to power off and on a few times but doesn't really help...I will be returning this product since I don't trust the brand anymore. Disappointing.",4
4,My new most-used kitchen appliance,27-Nov-18,Yes,"So far I've only used this to make smoothies and acai bowls, but boy have I made a lot of them. I do find that big chunks of frozen fruit (like the largest of strawberries) need to be cut up for better blending, otherwise you kind of have to shake the jar or poke things down. Once I got frozen fruit cut to the right size - I'd say about an inch - I haven't had an issue and can just let the blender run and sometimes stop the blender before the countdown -- just depends on the thickness you want. It's a little loud, but I think any good blender will be. Helps to set it on top of a folded kitchen towel and bring it forward on the counter rather than blending in a corner where sound reverberates more. Also, clean-up is a breeze and best done right away (a couple drops of dish soap and a cup of water, pulse for 10 seconds, rinse).",0
5,I'm a believer now! :),31-Oct-16,Yes,"I wasn't convinced we needed this but my wife won me over.  I'll have to say, she was right :).... this thing is amazing!  From Smoothies, to soups.... this blender is another level!  Great product and well worth the money!!",6
5,Son loves it,24-Jul-18,Yes,"See this as a today?€?s deal at 179.xx! It was a bargain at $189.xx when it was a Treasure Truck item a month or so ago!  I grabbed it at that price, not needing it, but realizing it was a steal. A few weeks later, my son was saying he?€?s starting a smoothie regimen but doesn?€?t have blender yet. Mom to the rescue! And I chatted with him later and he says he loves it! Gets every bit of flotsam suh-mooth! Great item.",1
5,This is one badass blender,17-Jun-17,Yes,"Holy Cow.  This thing is AWESOME..  When we opened it we had to do a little test on it first, just to see it's awesomeness.  We put in about 3 cups of ice and hit the surge button - within like 6-7 seconds it was snow... Not shaved ice, but snow.  I love everything about this blender.  I wish it would have come with a manual, but I printed it off on the Blendtec website.  I wish it would have been less expensive, but I have no regrets.  With this thing you definitely get what you paid for.  I chose a new one over a refurbished one, only because I preferred the 8 year warranty it offers.  I would highly recommend this blender to anyone.  It is just that AMAZING.",1
5,BEST BLENDER EVER!!!,5-Jun-18,Yes,"Will never use another blender! This blender will cut through everything. Supposedly it will blend a set of alpine skies, but I haven?€?t tested it out. I have no doubt it would though, it will literally blend anything I put in it...Easy to clean, easy to operate, lightweight, and very reliable! I?€?ve never had one issue with this product...Some reviews talk about loud noise, but I disagree. This blender is no louder than any other blender. If you?€?re going to be blending frozen fruit or anything else that is hard, it will obviously make some noise. Seriously, this is not an issue...Will never buy another blender again",0
2,You get what you pay for... sort of: save for a Vitamix,28-Dec-13,Yes,"I really wanted to like this blender.  After reading a lot of reviews, it seemed like it really wasn't just a substitute for a more expensive Vitamix, but was, in fact, a serious blender which could compete...Well, I've had it for a year and have never been satisfied.  Then, recently, my wife bought us a Vitamix 750 Pro Series.  Here's the skinny: save your money towards a Vitamix. In some of these reviews, people trash the Vitamix for this and that, but the reality is (and, granted, I can only speak for the Vitamix 750 Pro Series) that the Vitamix 750 is superior in absolutely every way by a large, uncontestable margin...The performance of this Blendtec is lackluster (though, see the next point and caveat I mention). Granted, it's better than the plain ol' KitchenAid blender sitting next to it, but at 3.5x the cost, it's not actually 3-4x better. Basic smoothies, less than 16oz worth, comprised of bananas, frozen berries, some frozen peaches, and some small chunks of frozen pineapple, are a chore for this blender... unless you run it on its maximum setting, at which it modestly just copes, but... and this is a huge but... (which brings me to the next point):..Oh my dear lord the unholy noise and racket this thing makes. Even at its lowest setting, WITH NOTHING IN IT, this thing makes the loudest motor noise I've ever heard except for my grandma's 30 year old ancient old-school beast. At its max setting (like if you use the Smoothie program and let it rev up to its max), I have to leave the room. It's intolerable. The whole unit vibrates like mad and I really feel like the thing is going to fly apart on the counter...To top this off, there's the infernal, flexible lid. Its design is such that when things shoot up onto it, and you take the lid off, the stuff unavoidably falls off and gets all over the counter. Ditto for the removable cap. The way it's affixed to the lid, you have to yank it off, which usually results in a spray of food particles on my cabinets. It's super annoying...I lived with this thinking nothing was better, and I was dead wrong.  This Vitamix is darn near silent on its lowest setting, tolerable at max, stable on its base at the limit and, above all, outperforms this thing all day long. Things which required me going to the max for up to a minute on the Blendtec are done on nearly the lowest setting within 30 seconds on the Vitamix...If this blender were 1/2 the price, it would be a value. At what it currently costs, I'm within 60% of the vitamix, and that extra 40% is money well spent, IMO.",15
3,Updated: Blendtec makes it right. Jar leaked during first use out of the box,1-Aug-18,Yes,"Received the blender today. Unpacked and followed directions to clean and set it up. Made my first smoothie that was an apple, banana, cucumber, lemon, celery, kale and ginger. The smoothie turned out delicious. The problem was during the first use the jar leaked between the plastic and the metal inset the blade is attached to. I?€?m processing a return. So disappointed..Update: Was going to return the blender and after speak with Blendtec on online the directed me to get a replacement part. I received it in four days and I'm very happy over the last few days how it has worked. Great customer service by Blendtec.",0
5,"Yummy! A Well Built, Powerful Blender",30-Jul-18,Yes,"I was reluctant to purchase this blender, but my daughter had one and demonstrated how well it worked. I'm glad she encouraged me to buy it. Now I can make the same smoothies that I used to buy at Tropical Smoothie - any time I want one. I use three flavors of protein powder and experiment with my own ingredients. This blender has a unique cutter blade in that it has no sharp edges, a nice safety feature. However, it is made thicker than most cutters so that does not stop it from pulverizing and mixing the food. The entire machine is solidly built with handy lines on the jar showing ounce, cup and milliliter measurements. The feature I like the most is the pre-programmed timer, where the machine makes smoothies at different spin levels during the process and stops itself after finishing. There are several more buttons but I have not tried anything yet other than the smoothie button.  Very happy with this device.",0
5,"LOVE IT! First I was hooked with ""will it ...",9-Jan-18,Yes,"LOVE IT!  First I was hooked with ""will it blend videos""..I have tried viamix, ninja However blendtec rules then all! Came back to this all the time.  Just be sure to add enough liquids to make it work right...Pros:.Easy to use.You can make hot soup.You can make slushies.Easy to clean.Fit's under the counter..Cons:.The ninja blender has a single portion jar where blentec does not",1
5,Great blender,4-Jan-18,Yes,"Just received my blendtec today and I am very impressed. So far I have made a couple smoothies and the result is very smooth. No raspberry seeds or blackberry seeds come out solid. Most of all, the soup! I followed the tortilla soup recipe in the book provided with the blender and man it is delicious. Like very good. I would definitely recommend this blender to someone in the market for one.",1
5,Changed my life.,6-Sep-14,Yes,"I?€?m surprised it has taken me this long to write a review. Sorry if this is a bit of a novel, but this blender has changed my life!! I?€?ve been using the Blendtec for the last two and a half years to make veggie shakes ?€? it is an amazing machine. Some folks prefer juicers as opposed to a blender, but I find that you waste all of the fiber, which is good for you and fills you up as well (you get something that is a bit more like juice with a juicer, but the Blendtec does an amazing job at making it pretty smooth and you don?€?t waste any part of the vegetables/fruits). I?€?m sure the Vitamix works well also, but the Blendtec seems to be more powerful (plus the Vitamix looks like it was designed in the 70s)...Quickly after I started juicing I started to lose weight, after 5 or 6 weeks I dropped 15lbs, while still enjoying what I wanted to eat for most meals...With regard to recipes there are all kinds of concoctions. I usually buy about 4 days?€? worth of veggies when I shop. My concoction is very green and consists of the following:..Kombucha (full bottle - as you need some liquid for blending).  I?€?d recommend the one with Chia seeds in it as it adds sweetness, tastes great, and has no carbonation (and Chia seeds are really high in Omega 3). Fermented drinks are really good for you and help break down foods in your system. Whole Foods sells their own brand of Kombucha as well (at least in the Bay Area). Coconut water is a good alternative, but I don?€?t care for the taste...Everything organic (not necessary, just personal preference):.Always 2 of the following (I mix it up): Kale, Dandelion greens, collard greens, broccoli, or watercress (I use half the bundle of kale, etc, that whole foods sells, except for the watercress which is smaller - I use the whole thing that Whole Foods sells as the serving)..A roma tomato (cheaper than slicer tomatoes).4 or so good size white mushrooms.2 medium size carrots or one large carrot.1/3 cucumber (I like the taste and it has some other benefits such as Vitamin E); I sometimes purchase red bell pepper in place of this (high in vitamin C, but I sometimes have a hard time finding the organic variety)...Starting out, you may want to add fruit if it is too bitter for you ?€? I typically added pears when I did, or sometimes strawberries for flavor (4 or 5 strawberries can impact the flavor quite a bit if you want it sweeter). Occasionally I also add some beets as these are really good for you (a great detoxifier as well)...This provides for about 40-48oz of liquid goodness (I really do love the flavor - it never gets old). I usually drink this 5 days out of the week for dinner (Sunday through Thursday). It takes me 15 minutes flat to prepare this. I usually supplement it with something else - perhaps yogurt or a small serving of fish (I also like to eat a small piece of dark chocolate (70-80% cocoa). For breakfast or lunch, I eat whatever I want (although, I?€?ve cut back on dairy and eggs recently). On weekends I usually splurge as well (beers, pizza, etc). I actually eat more than I used to. But every morning when I step on the scale I am right at 160lbs (I?€?m 5?€?8?€? with an athletic build). The fiber likely has a lot to do with it. And I?€?m not a big exercise buff - on a good week I?€?ll run twice (3 miles each session), and I?€?ll do a couple of free weight exercises once or twice a week...I?€?ve always suffered from high blood pressure (always at the high-end of pre-hypertension since my mid-twenties). I?€?m turning 40 next month and my last blood pressure reading was 104 over 70! Although, I have to admit that I became a Pescetarian last year (cut out meat except for seafood (wild only as a preference)), and I saw my biggest drop over the last year, but it could also be from the cumulative effect of the veggies over the past two and a half years...I turned to the blender after feeling like I was running out of energy and was having a harder time getting through the week at a stressful job. I am glad that I did - physically, I feel great (no medication, ailments, etc). I grew up on the East coast eating processed foods - I always had a microwave hot pocket in my hand so it was a radical change for me. The blender idea got in my head after watching a couple of those juicing documentaries from a couple of years ago (?€?Fat, Sick, and nearly dead?€? was one of them)...Anyhow, I?€?m sure I could go on and on (I know some of my co-workers would tell you the same, especially in the first year - although I?€?ve probably been responsible for over 15 Blendtecs sold among family, friends, and acquaintances - I should really start getting kickbacks from Blendtec). Admittedly it has not worked for everyone (can?€?t get into the taste or just can?€?t commit to it on a regular basis), but the majority of the folks have gotten a lot of benefit out of it and quite a few have become full converts like me. Anyhow, this has just been my experience with blending and I wanted to share it in the hopes it might help others with their health.",17
5,Powerful Little Beast of a Blender,23-Dec-12,Yes,"I have Ulcerative Colitis and after surgeries to remove my colon, I found it difficult to digest green leafy vegetables, so i started juicing and creating smoothies.  We purchased the Blendtec hoping to get an appliance that would liquify the kale, spinach, apples, berries, ginger, etc. that we used to make our green smoothies.  Our first blenders would chop the veggies into fine pieces, but not liquify like we wanted.  Then we bought the Blendtec.  First its smaller than the other big blender on the market by Vitamix. The jar is a plastic composite (smaller than the Vitamix I've seen in stores) - we make bulletproof coffee in it, but cool the liquid down a little before blending - the lid is vented to allow for steam to escape thus avoiding damage to the jar or lid.  I cannot comment on the use of a Vitamix, other than I have a friend who loves the Vitamix he received as a gift 5 or so years ago..The pre-programmed settings are amazing - the speeds of the blender adjust to create smoothies, shakes, whole juice drinks and other concoctions. The lcd screen readout shows what setting you're using and a timer, counting down the cycle. Sometimes i do have to run a cycle twice, but its usually a result of me overloading the jar with veggies and fruits..I have blown a 15 amp receptacle in the month of i owned this blender - i'm not sure if this attributed to the blender, user error or the contractor who wired my home..Its loud, but I would expect it to be loud, because of its powerful motor..It comes with a very well done recipe book, wire bound and well organized..Apparently, the Blendtec has a 7 year warranty and I've read reviews where folks are reporting exceptional customer service when replacing parts..After a week of use, i was so happy with the performance that I bought the wildside jar, its a little bigger than the 4-sided jar, but it spins better - blending your ingredients and liquifying everything in a vortex yielding a healthy drink of green goodness.",3
5,Best Blender I have ever used!,27-Feb-18,Yes,"This blender is amazing!  Let me start by saying I had the opportunity to try both a Blendtec blender and a Vitamix blender last year while living with roommates who owned these blenders.  After trying both I always defaulted to using the Blentec, it was easy to use, clean and did not require as much tamping down of the food inside.  My roommates' Blendtec had the Wildside jar, but I ended up getting the 4 sided jar because it was on sale.  It works just as well in my opinion...I have only had to tamp the food down inside my new Blendtec a few times but that was probably because I did not load it the way the instructions tell you to, which is liquids in first.  Also if there is not enough liquid in what you are making you might run into having to add more liquid or tamp the food down/mix it up.  I am still learning this blender and have started to be able to avoid these situations by loading it properly and making sure I blend things with enough liquids to start and then adding solids in on top...Other than that I love this blender, and would still give it 5 stars.  It is by far the best blender I have ever used!",1
5,Awesome Machine,6-Jan-16,Yes,"I purchased this Blendtec blender after seeing it on a TV show called Modern Marvels on the History Channel. After watching what this blender could devour I knew my wife would love it. I ordered it just a few days before Christmas and Amazon got it to me on Christmas Eve. It is very user friendly with lots of preset programs so you can start it and when it shuts off it's done. We have used it to make smoothies, ice cream, and believe it or not butter from whipping cream. This machine is awesome. It come with an 8 year warranty so you know they built it to last. It is a bit on the pricey side but it will more than likely be the last blender you buy.",5
2,Expected more from this blender,15-Jun-18,Yes,"IMHO, I expected more from this type of blender. I didn't like for the following reason..1) When mixing frozen strawberries and ice I have to stop it several times to push the ice down in order for it to blend it.2) The bottom of t he plastic container is starting to leak..I should've bough the vitamix.",1
5,"Love this blender, but not the Blender Wars",2-Jan-12,Yes,"For at least a few years, I debated the wisdom of buying a four or five hundred dollar blender, and frankly life would have been fine even if I hadn't finally buckled and bought this brand. But I ultimately considered it to be an investment, like a good range, and am very happy with this purchase. I debated Vitamix vs. Blendtec for quite awhile, and my decision came down to the Blendtec because one jar can be used for both dry and wet blending; the Vitamix requires separate jars...Not having tried a Vitamix, I can't speak to its performance, but for heaven's sake, enormous quantities of Vitamix blenders have been sold so they must be getting something right. Ditto for  Blendtec. This is a high powered blender that will annihilate anything you put into it. And yes it's loud, sorry, but that's what happens with this much horsepower. It has earned a permanent place in my kitchen after only a few months of use...So I give this my hearty recommendation, but please let's put aside the tiring blender wars and allow everybody to find the brand that most fits their needs.",9
5,Best blender I've ever owned,31-May-18,Yes,I upgraded from a Cuisinart PowerEdge 5 Speed Blender. Wow that blender was a lot worse than I thought it was or this Blendtec is super awesome...Blended my regular smoothie ingredients in half the time and to a smoother consistency than any of my previous blenders..Quieter than all my previous blenders..Shorter than all my previous blenders..Awesomer than all my previous blenders.,0
3,"Its OK, It blends but expected much more for the price.",13-Jun-18,Yes,"A little disappointed with this blender. It is powerful and blends some things fairly well but not as well as expected. The blender has a single thick dull blade which will never get duller but it doesn't do as good of a job as other blenders with multiple sharper blades. It blends a smoothie alright but I have to scrap the sides of the jar and lid at least once get the leafy bits fully blended. It also leaves pieces of raspberry and blackberry seeds in the finish smoothie. It failed at making my hummus recipe that I've made for years in a cheap bullet clone blender. It fails at making snowy ice cream. It just creates a cavity of air around the blade.  This blender need excess of liquid IMO for it to blend properly and some things suffer from that extra liquid. I know there is a extra jar I could buy that may help with making thick recipes but at an additional $100+...Sorry NO. And then there is the issue with the reliability of the machine. A large percentage of buyers have problems with the jar or the base. I know it has a long warranty but how is that warranty handled after the 2nd or 3rd replacement? Does that warranty change after the 1st replacement, It doesn't sound like a product that is built to last...I can't recommend this blender and if I had it to do over again I would probably just buy a sub $100 blender and a sub $200 food processor.",4
4,This blender is amazing! From small items to large items,2-Feb-16,Yes,"This blender is amazing!  From small items to large items, it puree's them all.  Easy to use, easy to clean, seems sturdy on counter when running it (doesn't bounce around).  I like the large square opening on top.  Easy to put all manner of things into.  The lid is sometimes a bit tricky to get on so the ""lip"" is on the outside and makes a seal.  But as long as I am paying attention to make sure the lid is on correctly, there are no problems.  Sides are easy to scrape with a spatula.  It is a little on the noisy side.  This morning my dog came to bark at it while it was running.  Would recommend to a friend although it is on the pricier side.",2
5,Great product!,12-Sep-17,Yes,"Great product!.Powerful, easy to clean and compact design..Love the pre-set cycles which allow you to have the perfect consistency (without over or under blending)..You can easily pour the liquid into a glass from all 4 corners of the blender without making a mess..Would definitely recommend the Blendtec! This is a great purchase!",2
5,Best blender I have owned!,3-Mar-15,Yes,"Love this blender, best I have ever owned!  Yes, it was expensive, but it is definitely worth the price.  With the 3 hp motor, it does an excellent job of whatever you put in the container.  Absolutely love the smoothie button.  Put everything you love in the container, push the button and it does everything until your smoothie is as smooth as silk, then it shuts off by it's self.",4
4,Leaking now....but took a licking,25-Aug-13,Yes,"I purchased the Blendtec in 2009 and it has had heavy usage blending up to 20 Bosch fridge made ice cubes (Bosch ice cubes are very slow but very solidly made -- German design!) in protein shakes several times per week.  Then my son came home from college and starting using it 3 times a day this year.  Well, now it leaks.  But after roughly 4 years, I'm reasonably satisfied.  The one star reduction is for the ridiculously high price for the replacement container.  Unless this is some kind of Krypton style plastic, I doubt it costs them more than $5 to crank them off the assembly line somewhere in the emerging markets.",5
5,I love this blender!,3-Apr-13,Yes,"I love this blender! I spent way too much money for it, so it is a guilty purchase. However, I use it quite a bit. I often use it for smoothies in the morning. I add a couple cups of spinach, and it chops it up so much I have absolutely no chunks in my smoothie. I often use it when I freeze bananas with almond milk to make vegan banana ice cream-- delicious! I don't even utilize the ice cream setting and it turns out perfectly. I haven't utilized the soup portion very often, but it chops chops chops so well!..I put it in my dishwasher almost every day, and the blades do not have any wear or tear. Only disadvantage is that it makes a lot of noise if you are concerned about that being a problem.",5
5,Our INCREDIBLE BLEND TEC!,2-May-12,Yes,"Our BlendTec blender rocks! Super easy to clean, operate, and does such a super job that I can't stop telling people about it.  It took less than 3 seconds to completely shred 2 large boiled chicken breasts for chicken salad.  I have used it to coursely chop celery and carrots to use for stuffed bell peppers. We've made salsas using all sorts of veggies...At first it intimidated me.  I did not want to waste my expensive organic fruits and veggies making wierd concoctions.  But I have learned to keep it on low, pressing the ^ button only once. That way it does not whir everything into a liquid until I want it to.  I can actually prepare recipes so much more quickly.  The only thing it does not do is SLICE.  Cleanup is a breeze and it is attractive enough to leave on the kitchen counter...but not too tall that it couldn't be put in a cabinet...Amazon mailed it to me within days. It is VERY UNCOMPLICATED to use and comes with a small cookbook.  It is less expensive than the Costco Blender and easier to clean.  My daughter has the Costco blender.  I've used them both. Following the directions to put wet/liquid items in first, then the chunky things and Ice on top makes smoothies very easy.  I did blend some roasted nuts into Cashew Butter and had to stop, poke the sides with a spatula a couple of times to get the butter to move so that more nuts could be ground, but it was so simple and easy...just use a long spoon, or spatula...This would make a very good gift for someone who wants to incorporate more fiber, fruits and veggies into their diet.  Unlike a juicer, the whole piece of fruit or vegetable is used.  Dr. Oz has convinced me that eating lots more green, leafy vegetables is good for us.  Put some seedless organic grapes (resveratol), frozen peaches, carrots, and baby spinach leaves into this blender...add ice and even a sprig of mint and Voila!! Delicious and healthy drink.  My husband made an iced coffee drink one morning. Making baby food from leftovers would be a great money saver for young families too.  The list is endless!..No blender is quiet.. this one is very tolerable, so the loud noise is not an issue.",5
5,Brand new. 8 year warranty.,28-Dec-17,Yes,"Another great buy! Mine arrived brand new. It works fine. I've only had it a day, so maybe I'll update later. I tested to make sure it worked and then I registered the warranty on the Blendtec web site. I verified that I am registered for an 8 year warranty. For $160, I am pleased to say that I got a great deal.I'm still playing with it - what can I make with my Blendtec? I'll update later. I bought directly from Amazon and Amazon is a registered seller on the Blendtec web site.",1
5,Great for smoothies!!,25-Jul-12,Yes,"This is my favorite appliance by far. I tried juicing first and was not pleased with the results, too watery and tasteless. It seemed like I was wasting a lot of the good stuff from the fruits and veggies I was juicing. Not so with my Blendtec! Your smoothies will be chalk full of fiber, enzymes and vitamins/ minerals...I like that it easily fits on the counter and isn't monstrous like a Vitamix. I get about 4 servings using the regular cup. I make tasty ""green"" smoothies for my entire family! Everyone loves them and they can't tell that I have blended greens into their drinks! You don't need to buy any fancy smoothie recipe books, just get in there and experiment! I find that most of the smoothie books contain ingredients that I don't have access to at a regular store. Just start by adding liquid, either water and/or fruit juice, then add fresh greens and fruit and top it off with frozen fruit. Add more water if necessary and sprinkle Stevia to taste and voila, you are done!",1
2,Not worth the price. Doesn't blend well.,23-Jun-18,Yes,Very disappointed. This was a gift for my brother. He has been using it for a few months and he is quite disappointed. It will not blend well not even frozen bananas! Definitely not worth the price.,2
5,Everything we expected,9-Aug-13,Yes,"My wife wanted to get one of these for a while, and we finally pulled the trigger.  While I rarely used a blender when we had our ""average, everyday"" model, I use this one almost every day.  My iced coffee smoothies are consistently frothy and yummy..We like this model because it has specific buttons for ""milkshake"", ""smoothie"", ""soups"", etc. that are programmed to speed up and slow down over time to optimize what you're making.  This blender is pretty small (seems much smaller than the Vitamix) but is very powerful -- the motor is 1560 watts, which is 2-3 times as powerful as your typical blender.  Wow..From what we've read the Blend-Tec and Vitamix are similar -- the reason we got this one was that it was on sale.  We are very happy with our purchase.  These blenders are expensive, but they are worth it, especially if you can get a discount on one.",1
5,Worth every penny!,8-Jan-18,Yes,"Love my Blendtec! Worth every penny of investment?€?it saves time because it does the job quickly and easily, it cleans up so well, and makes cooking paleo and from scratch enjoyable. I highly recommend it.",1
5,Definitely an upgrade over my other blender,2-May-18,Yes,"Wasn't sure how much better this would do over my old Kitchen Aid blender, but this is so much nicer! The blades in this Blendtec are not sharp, which makes it so much easier to clean and don't have to worry about the kids washing and getting cut. And... it just blends everything so much better! No more random chunks of frozen fruit in my smoothies. Glad I made this purchase, definitely an upgrade over my other blender.",0
5,The flour was super fine and ready for bread and it does 2 ...,16-Feb-18,Yes,"I milled flour for bread with it. As other reviewers mentioned, it does cloud up the walls of the carafe. But I knew that going in and it hasn't changed the functionality of the blender.  The flour was super fine and ready for bread and it does 2 cups of wheat berries in 50 seconds.  That is amazing by any standards.  Smoothies are super smooth, milkshakes are perfect.  I love my blender!",0
2,Returned after 2 weeks of daily use,24-Feb-18,Yes,we bought the blendtec after reading positive reviews. We started a plant based diet and begun to use the blender two to three times a day. I first noticed I wasn't a fan because I couldn't make enough in one pitcher for me and my husband. I have to run it for each member of our family. After about a week I noticed some of the fruits weren't being blended as well. Then we noticed the blade seemed to be moving slower. So we returned it.,1
5,Everything I always wanted,12-May-18,Yes,"Great blender, no issues at all and it works like a dream. I am so pleased with my purchase . We actually get a lot of use out of this. It is loud, but that's a small sacrifice for what it does really well! We make soups, smoothies,whole juices and I cant wait to do more! This blender is so versatile I love it, even clean up is super easy.",0
5,I LOVE this blender,25-Jun-18,Yes,"I LOVE this blender. It has a smart engine - knows when to speed up or slow down with the preset buttons. It pulverizes kale stems, so I can include them in my smoothies. It handles 9 cubes of ice plus 2 cups frozen fruit easily. Just be aware that you need to start with at least 3/4 cups of liquid, so it's not great for small quantities of paste-like recipes, such as for rubs.",0
5,Four years later it's still like new. It has also proven to be durable,23-Mar-18,Yes,"I bought this as a special gift for a friend because it's the most important small appliance in my own kitchen.  The Blendtec is used several times a day in our home for smoothies, grating hard cheese, grinding almonds for almond meal and oats for flour, making salad dressings, soups, etc., etc.  Four years later it's still like new.  It has also proven to be durable, amazingly versatile, and very easy to clean.",0
5,Great So Far,22-Jul-18,Yes,Have had this machine for only a few months but so far it has been great.  Easy to use.  Easy to clean. 1000% improvement over the inexpensive blender I had.  Read the instructions.  Hope this lasts many years.  Would have preferred a glass jar but the plastic was very heavy sandpapers to be durable and is also BPA free.,0
5,Excellent Blender,19-Mar-16,Yes,"We've had this for close to 5 years and are extremely pleased with it. It is Durable and of a high build quality. The bearing on the blade of the original jar had went out last year and Blentec immediately sent a replacement to Canada at no charge..Also wanted to mention the height of this. It's fits good under my cupboards, some out there may not? Something to keep in mind.",2
5,It circulates the stuff in the jar a lot better than my previous blender so there's no effort on ...,13-Jun-17,Yes,"It will blend whatever you throw at it. My girlfriend made a kick ass pesto the other night and we generally blend smoothies. It circulates the stuff in the jar a lot better than my previous blender so there's no effort on my part to manually shake things up.. The rubber lid seems to stay on so I imagine you could just fill it, turn it on, and walk away... though I'm too careful to try. The counter is a fun little snippet of information.",1
4,Good enough,3-Feb-16,Yes,"Yeah, it seems overpriced to me. But the lifestyle using it is good, I'm finding. All the smoothies I've made so far taste good to me and they're healthy...Operationally, I have no complaints. I like using the pulse key and it sure blends vegetables and fruit quickly. The lid works very well. Cleaning is easier than I expected, no problem at all.",2
1,"So happy, then too quickly disappointed",26-Apr-13,Yes,"Update Sept 2015: my blender has started malfunctioning. I'm pretty angry about it. I have used it 2-3 times a week,sometimes less for 2.5 years. Around the 2 year mark, the motor started doing wierd things while blending---- it would get incredibly loud... I mean it's very loud already but I'm talking crazy ridiculous loudness at times, it would shake uncontrollably-- back and forth, side to side. Sometimes there is a smell when blending. Not completely like a fiery smell but something similar. Now it has started really struggling to blend some simple fruits that aren't even frozen. And today the motor is running wihout spinning the blades. I reviewed blenders for months before buying and had a very hard time first deciding to go with a ninja-type blender for around $120 or with the Cadillac level of blenders (blendtec or vitamix). All the things I read brought up points about how the latter 2 blended at speeds or temps that kept more of the molecules and whatever of the foods intact and is better for me. So I looked only at blendtec and vitamix. It was tough to decide. I chose the blendtec because of the more compact size, plastic pitcher(I break things easily) and people said that more button options was better. I chose these features despite many reviews stating that the vitamix motor would really last for 20+ years and blendtec couldn't stand up to it. I wish I would have listened. After having invested almost $500 in this blender, I'm not going to spend so much only 2.5 years later. I guess I'm screwed since I bought it here on amazon and apparently blendtec doesn't accept returns when not bought directly from them. I would no longer recommend this Blendtec blender...I love this blender. I'll admit that after 2 uses I wondered if I'd made a mistake spending so much on a blender. But I got the hang of how much liquid to use, order of ingredients etc. after 3-4x. I read reviews btw blendtec and vitamix for 2 mos. I ultimately chose this bc it fits on the counter. It blends so perfectly. Greens-- kale, chard, dandelion,spinach; fruit--berries, bananas, oranges, apples. Veggies--beets, carrots... These are what I've used so far. Strawberry seeds are no problem ( but on my first 2 blends they were very coarse) I think I didn't use enough liquid. All my smoothies and juices have come out unbelievably smooth. I love LOVE LOVE LOVE how easy this is to clean. It's a joke. Just rinse. Drop of dish soap. Rinse. I use it currently 2-3x day and I know I wouldn't use it nearly thisuch if cleaning were any kind of an issue. I will say that my only issue is that u can't push stuff down while blending (I think u can with vitamix) however I haven't had to stop and push after my first few blends. It's all about getting the hang of how much liquid to use for what you're blending. But it comes naturally with use, it's a no-brainier. I feel that bc of vitamix being so tall it would be harder to fit under the faucet and rinse. And like I said, I'm over the moon regarding ease of cleaning the blendtec. It looks good on the counter too. I love it. No complaints.",16
5,Power and more power,24-Jan-17,Yes,"I have over 100 cycles on this blender and it still powers through anything I throw at it. Used daily for fruit smoothies, including frozen fruits.",2
5,Awesome Blender!,29-Nov-13,Yes,"This is an awesome blender! I have owned this blender for a few months now. I love that I can put large chunks of ice in it and blend away without a care. I use this blender about 3 - 4 times per week. I hand wash the blender after every use...Before I made the decision to buy this blender I had to think... Do I want to go through ten $40 blenders (over the course of a few years), or buy something of quality that will last...I absolutely love this blender and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality blender.",3
5,Best blender I've ever used,19-Mar-18,Yes,"Simply amazing. It's all about the horsepower when it comes to blenders. Dont waste your money on the $50 or $100 low-horsepower blenders. Splurge for this one. It's really worth it, it blends up kale so finely, you don't get the bits and chunks in your mouth. Also great for broccoli cheddar soup and fruit smoothies.",0
5,Satisfied customer,6-Aug-18,Yes,I've wanted a Blendtec for a long time and when the price went down - I couldn't resist anymore! It is so nice to be able to vent the top for hot things and to add ingredients as it's running. It pulverizes everything I've tried so far and I'm thrilled with it!,0
4,Works great.,6-Nov-18,Yes,"This thing is awesome, love it so far. Unfortunately mine was missing the small plastic insert for the lid.",1
5,Excellent Upgrade from My Kitchen Aid,19-Feb-12,Yes,"I bought this to replace a really sub-par Kitchen Aid blender with the removable bottom. I was suspect about paying so much for a blender but I'm convinced it is the last one I will ever own. I primarily use it to make smoothies in the morning before work when speed and efficiency are a must. This Blendtec motor is absolutley amazing - pulverizing frozen whole strawberries and the like without a hitch. I love the programmed controls which result in perfeclty blended smoothies, milkshakes (a huge hit with my kids and husband) and soups. I love that the Blendtec container is all one piece and does not have the dangerous and highly unreliable removable bottoms that traditional blenders have. What a relief to not have to worry about whther the bottom is properly attached or about whether I'm going to cut myself when cleaning. One curious feature: it has a displayed on-going digital count of how many times you've used it. Not sure what purpose it serves but at least I've used it 50 times in 60 days so I'm on my way to getting my money's worth. Excellent blender - no regets.",4
5,Blendtec TB-621-20 Blender,28-Aug-10,Yes,"Let me preface the comments with the statement that I rarely cook.  I have only had the blender about 1 month, but have used it 18 times and would have used it more except for the need for groceries.  We make mostly fruit and ice smoothies.  By adding a cup of raw spinich and some carrots, we have increased fruit and vegetable consumption, reduced chain-store yogurt consumption, and reduced calorie intake from processed snacks.  This can be done in the time of a TV commercial.  I am still trying new recipes (mostly whatever I have) each time.  I never owned a really nice blender before and used my previous blender (a 30-year-old wedding present) for egg custards, but not for more powerful uses. With the Blentec, I've made soups.  As winter approaches, we will use more often. I probably will not use for salsa, because I love CHUNKY onion, cilantra, and tomato salsa.  The Blentec might be too smooth. This purchase is worth the money.  By following the directions of a cup of warm water and a drop of dishwashing detergent immediately following use, I have had no problems cleaning the container. However, I do see that eventually, the polycarbonate jar will need replacing, which is not cheap.  I cannot yet predict that amount of uses before replacement. I would re-purchase this item.",6
5,Worth It,19-Jan-17,Yes,"I had blenders before,  but I use this one so much!  Soups have been awesome in the winter!  Blendtec has great recipes online.  Favorite yet:  Butternut squash and red pear soup.  So easy to make great smoothies and batters too.  I'm trying so many new things - like chia seed pudding?  My diet has def improved with this blender.  Not sure why I like using it...it's bulkier than my Ninja, but seems much easier to clean!  I think it's the shape and material of the jar.",1
4,Super strong decibels,25-Dec-17,Yes,"The wall - breaking machine, although it looks simple, is very powerful and can crush any food. The only drawback is that the sound is too big! Super strong decibels!",1
5,The Most Awesome Blender Ever,26-Aug-13,Yes,I have owned many blenders and have burned them out in a year or so. My husband makes smoothies every day and I use it quite often as well. I bought this in June of 2007 and it has been so great. It blends anything I put in it. I had a friend make me a smoothie in her brand new VitaMix and it didn't turn out as smooth with her pushing the fruit down as mine does in 3/4 of the time. I love Blendtec. Go to YouTube and check out will it blend. It shows how great this blender is.,4
5,A Lifestyle Changer,7-Jan-12,Yes,"I thought I'd gone a little crazy when I ordered this. The price was daunting to me, but it was my Christmas gift to myself, and I figured I was worth it..When I began to search for smoothie recipes, I came across greensmoothiegirl.com, and it was a lucky hit. It set me on a search for nutrition information, and we're now eating healthier, and I credit it all to Blendtec. As someone else wrote, they should include a copy of ""Green for Life"" by Victoria Boutenko.  I think I've become an evangelist!.I'm almost 80 yrs. old, so it's not to late to learn ""new stuff"".",6
5,"Amazing blender, use it almost daily",7-Apr-18,Yes,"Amazing blender, use it almost daily. Got protection plan with it. Easy to use, Clean, powerful. 3hp I use it to make fruit/vegetable/tuber smoothies. Have not explored all its features, I only use pulse setting, and manual up to 10.",0
5,Awesome Service. That's why I love Amazon,6-Feb-18,Yes,"Package was lost first time but reshipped immediately after contact Amazon. Awesome Service. That's why I love Amazon. Blender works great. No complains at this moment. Very convenient and quick to make smoothie in the morning, with frozen fruits bought from Costco.",0
5,Great product and above average support.,1-Aug-18,Yes,"Really love the quality of their products.  Love the program buttons, just push the desired setting and walk away.  No fooling with dials..After 5 years my old jar had a problem.  They replaced it no questions asked, I'm sold!!",0
5,Great for home made  soup in a hurry,20-Oct-11,Yes,"I just got this Blendtec and ""invented"" this soup that came out REALLY well in just minutes. The only thing I would try to change when I have more time is to try using cooked soy beans instead of processed soy milk. If you avoid soy, a half a cooked potato should work, too. I love the Blendtec. It cleans up in a few effortless minutes because you don't take the base apart to clean it...Carrot and Kale Soup for one.1 cup organic, unsweetened soy milk (Silk), heat to steaming, put in Blendtec.Chop the following and add:.  1-2 tablespoons of onion.  1/2-1 cup kale.  1 carrot, shredded.  1 celery stalk.  1/2 Granny Smith apple.Blend on ""Soup"" mode twice, blend on ""Pulse"" mode 5 seconds.Serve, top with croutons, salt and pepper to taste",4
4,A bit of a monster.,12-Jun-13,Yes,"This things looks and sounds like it could blend just about anything.  I haven't really had a chance to put it through its paces yet but so far, initial impressions are good.  The build quality of the base unit is very good, the touch pad seems to be very responsive and the container is pretty sturdy...My only worry is that in the few initial tests I've done with it, it tends to emit a melting or burning plastic smell.  I'm hoping this will go away as it gets used more, but it doesn't give me much confidence in the longevity of this device, especially for the incredible cost.",1
5,Fantastic Blender,1-Feb-10,Yes,"I've waited to review this till I had a chance to use it over several months, and the 'honeymoon' period had ended...First, this is a fantastic blender.  I probably consume about 100% more fruits and vegetables now thanks to the smoothie/raw juice settings.  I just put whatever I want into the unit, press the button, and about 1 minute later it's done...This model has plenty of power, and I've yet to hear it sound like its having troubles blending anything I've put into it...It also is extremely easy to clean.  I simply rinse the lid and canister in hot water when I'm done.  No muss and no fuss...I'm also happy with the size of it.  It neatly sits on the counter top and doesn't take up a bunch of room.  It is also small enough to fit easily in my cabinet.  The black and chrome exterior with the blue LED readout is also nice looking...Like the other reviews; however, it can be a bit loud.  Not painful rock concert loud by any means, but loud enough that it's probably not a good idea to blend something at 2 AM while others are sleeping.  ;)",11
5,got it from treasure truck and it was a super good deal,8-May-18,Yes,got it from treasure truck and it was a super good deal.  it's not as good as the vitamix but it's half the size  and half the price compared the vitamix.  it does do a good job overall.  if you're on the fence; get it and you won't disappoint.,0
5,My wife loves this blender,27-Jul-13,Yes,"I bought this as a present for my wife because she loves to drink smoothies, but our old blender would not do the job. I did my research before spending this kind of money and the Blendtec has the biggest motor you can find and has the longest warranty. Plus it is built in the USA and with this economy we need to support US companies at every turn..This blender does it all and does it with ease. While some of the other products on the market only have two speeds, this Blendtec unit has a multitude of settings to accomplish any task. A great product.",2
5,Awesome blender,21-Feb-15,Yes,"Awesome. That's all I can say. You really can't go wrong with this product. Obviously the price is the big blocker here, but I got it b/c I don't like fruits or veggies on their own, for the most part, and making smoothies with them has been a great way for me and the kids to get our fruits and veggies daily. Oh, and cleaning it is almost fun.",2
5,Only thing is if you plan to use it for foods that stain like red chili peppers or beets,26-Jan-18,Yes,"Bought 2 of these now as gifts. My family loves them. Only thing is if you plan to use it for foods that stain like red chili peppers or beets, the cup will stay a bit stained. It's no big deal for me but for my mom it was. Quality is good and very pretty too. I also have a vitamix and works almost as great!",0
5,This girl's favorite blender!,5-Jan-17,Yes,"Completely in love with this blender! I know it sounds silly, but I'm a health nerd and I choose all the best appliances and gadgets to make my healthy lifestyle that much better!",2
5,Great for making Raw Goodies,24-Oct-12,Yes,"I bought this blender for my Raw Food kitchen endeavors. Boy has it made a difference in food prep. It's so powerful! If I wasn't so busy with work, I know I'd be in the kitchen using this thing to make tasty food several times a day. It is loud, but it's so fast and efficient that I don't mind. I make dressings from nuts and seeds, and they come out smooth and creamy. I've made soups, smoothies, and nut milks. They always come out just super smooth. I used a vitamix at my old job and I liked it, but without the timer it was hard for me to know when something was done, and I always had to be right next to it to keep an eye on it. I'd say both the vitamix and blendtec are pretty loud. So I like timer and settings of the blendtec, because it makes it easy for a kitchen novice like me and allows me to walk away for a minute and do something else (or just get away from the noise), without worrying that it will overblend. Overall I am very happy to own this product. It's certainly made eating and food preparation a lot more fun and easy. It's hard to imagine a raw food lifestyle (with my crazy schedule) without it.",1
5,Blendtec for Great Smoothies,26-Mar-15,Yes,"I bought the Blendtec after doing a lot of research.  I am very happy with this blender.  I make smoothies (most of the time with frozen fruit) and this blender is fantastic - no lumpy bits of fruit left after smoothie processing.  I have not had a chance to use for anything else at this point, but have been receiving great recipes from Blendtec in my email.  I would recommend this blender.  I loved the price!  Cheers",3
5,Easy to Clean,9-Sep-13,Yes,"I gave in and decided to buy a High End Blender, but it was worth the money. I use the Bledtec about 4 times a week for 'green smoothies' and they are smooth (ie. no leaf chunks floating around). I do not have a dishwasher, so ease of washing is very important. The blendtec is easy to wash (at least compared to my last blender, which had razer blades that made me bleed occasionally). Plus it is light.",3
5,Working great. Take less than a minutes to make a ...,2-Jan-18,Yes,"Working great. Take less than a minutes to make a tasty smoothie and easy clean too.  By the way, it did total crush the seed.",1
5,Don't know how I lived without this!,23-Jun-18,Yes,"Awesome blender! I've been wanting a high-speed blender for a while but struggled with how much they cost. There are some things I wanted to make that required or would be easier/better with a high-speed blender than my standard blender but I'm not a daily smoothie person and I couldn't quite justify spending so much money on an appliance I would use once every week or two. However, I did get a fabulous deal on this through the Treasure Truck which included the Twister Jar as well as the FourSide Jar and now I'm absolutely loving the blender. I've used both jars for making a variety of things including nut butters and nut milks. It's one of those things where you know it'll be more efficient than your garden-variety $40 blender but HOLY COW! when you actually use it you realize really could blend an iPhone! The program buttons are great (never had one with my cheap blender). Love dropping everything in, hitting a button, and letting the Blendtec work it's way up to the correct speed. Now I'm starting to look for recipes that require a high-speed blender! It's summer right now but I'm planning on making soups this winter! Love the idea of throwing things in and getting hot soup straight from the blender...It's also much easier to clean than I expected. I've always had a blender where the bottom screws off and I worried about cleaning around the blades without being able to remove the bottom. Fortunately, it really hasn't been a problem. And since the blades aren't sharp (like my cheapy blender), getting down there to clear out the remains of nut butter isn't a dangerous prospect. Then, with a bit of water, a couple of drops of soap and a few pulses, the blender nearly cleans itself!..Overall, I'm really, really happy that I splurged on this (though it was much less of a splurge than it would have been). I can definitely see myself working up to using this several times a week even if I'm never going to be a kitchen-sink smoothie kind of person!",2
5,Amazing Blender! I did do a lot of research ...,27-Jan-18,Yes,"Amazing Blender!.I did do a lot of research on this product and vitamix product.  I saw YouTube User Videos and I also checked to see if some of these people giving reviews had a vested interest in selling one brand over the other.  Because you have to find their bias...Now people on YouTube that sold both the Blendtec and Vitamix compared them in much fairer way and had both products side by side doing the same tasks...Other YouTube people were very biased because they would do things with the product they didn't sell that was unfair...I have only owned this product a week and it was packed in a brown box that is boxed by blendtec itself probably because if they shipped it via FedEx people would see the retail box and steal it.  In the store they have retail box...I checked the manufacture date on mine and it was 11/17 , and it looked brand new...They have made changes in the jar with more silicon-metal fortified bottom, I saw the old method with large rubber gaskets that some people complained about...Also, this product comes with FULL 8 year warranty that covers everything, Jar and Base, and Blendtec pays shipping both ways if something goes wrong...Both Vitamix and Blendtec have reviewers that say ""vitamix sucks"" or ""blendtec sucks"" , so it's a wash...Both are good machines with American Companies that have very good warranties...If you get a lemon , which happens with all products, return it or call the company and report back how they treat you...I bought it for 179 dollars within the last month, and I see new Vitamix 5200 going for 395 dollars.  Even this blendtec the last couple of weeks was up to 395 too...So far I haven't needed to use tamper or twister jar, but if I need it I can pick one up.  In the YouTube Videos I saw that compared doing same task, the vitamix needed the tamper and the blendtec didn't.  But there might be times when it could be useful, and alternate Jar company makes just a ""tamper-lid"" for 20 dollars that fits the blendtec jar that is included with this product.  I don't think I need it , but if I do that is one of my options...Like with any product, I read the manual and am using the product as directed.  And it works great for me.  If I run into a problem I will add to my post...I",2
5,Can never complain about my BlendTec! if you want ...,19-Apr-18,Yes,"Can never complain about my BlendTec! if you want to feel rich, just buy this and make food and smoothies with it. Grinds everything to a pulp, and can heat them... I mean I dont have much to say other than i use it at least once a day... And i dont mind that it doesnt hav a tamper, less to clean and you can always pulse extra stuff in later. Superb!",0

5,love it love it love it!,30-Dec-09,Yes,"This thing is great! I previously had a typical kitchen blender, but had the privilege of using a friend's Vita-mix for a few weeks...I thought it would be exactly the same, but it isn't...in a good way. There is a slight learning curve, but not much. The good differences are: ease of cleaning, for sure! Size! Also, it has pre-programmed cycles, AS WELL AS a pulse up and pulse down button so that one can manually blend. The only thing I have not figured out is why it tells me digitally how many cycles it has run? Anyone know offhand?.I highly recommend this! Loving the fresh veggie smoothies that are SOOOO SMOOTH.",5
5,Love and STILL use this product every week,7-Feb-18,Yes,"Love and STILL use this product every week. Not a big smoothie person but I still find ways to use this every week or so, whether it's soup or sauce or just need a quick guac fixer.",0
5,Well worth the money.,3-Sep-18,Yes,"Amazing what a quality blender can do, versus your under $100 blenders. Spend the money, wait for the sale, you will never look back.",0
5,Big motor = big yummie smoothies,26-Jul-11,Yes,"We make a lot of smoothies at our house.  Our Kitchenaid couldn't handle the frozen fruit and after a while plastic pieces in the mechanism broke.  After reading other reviews we splurged on this Blendtec.  Love it!!!!  The smoothie setting is perfect, and the countdown timer helps the kids to stay patient.  Much easier to clean, too.  The light plastic pitcher is a lot nicer to work with than my old heavy glass one.  It is expensive, but it's worth it!..Update - January 2014 - 455 smoothies and she's still going strong!",3

5,Definitely Recommended!,6-Nov-17,Yes,"My wife's sister has had one of these for over a year and spoken very highly of it. Since we only had a hand me down of our own, we decided it was time to make the switch too and we've been more than happy. We like it a lot.",1
5,"I highly recommend this blender, save money - buy from warehouse",24-Oct-12,Yes,"My 12 year old vitamix was finally dying out on me so I've been looking at this particular blender for a while..I've seen the ""Will it blend"" videos on YouTube and was amazed at the power of the machine.. I noticed the price on amazon was $400 and higher, then I looked at the Amazon warehouse deals and found one like new for $270...it got delivered in 2days thanks to my Amazon prime membership. the blender was in excellent condition, it's like the box was never even opened and I saved myself $130. Great deal. oh and by the way, it's better than my old one. :)",0
5,I like it,21-Aug-18,Yes,It's a little on the noisy side that I really like the ease-of-use and the smooth blending. Lots of power I still need to make ice cream,0
5,Works perfectly.,24-Jul-17,Yes,Perfect. So far no issues since bought during thanksgiving special sale on Amazon.,1
5,love it,8-Oct-18,Yes,"I use it to make fruit slush, milk slush, iced blended coffee, Chinese dessert--sesame paste, soybean milk and much more.  Love it!!",0
4,great blender! definitely recommend!!!!!,26-Apr-18,Yes,such a good deal!!!! thank you Treasure truck! a little noisy but overall a great blender so many options and it really does blend well! 4/5 only because of the noise.,0
5,Best blender ever! I love everything about my blendtec,23-Jan-18,Yes,I love every single thing about my blendtec I've used it everyday even got my husband drinking smoothies for breakfast. My only complaint(which isn't really a complaint) is that the jar isn't big enough. But i will be ordering the better jar very soon.,0
5,Awesome,13-Jan-11,Yes,"I had been putting off for quite some time getting the Blendtec due to the price...BUT.....I finally decided to buy it for health reasons.  There are all sorts of ""food healing"" recipes for smoothies using ""real, organic food"".  I love making these smoothies and knowing I am getting the nutrients I need from food and not supplement pills.  The bonus was the ""extensive"" recipe book that came with the Blendtec (I already had smoothies recipes)....and I was pleasantly surprised to see all of the other things you can make with the Blentec....nut butters, soups, desserts, milkshakes, etc.  It fits nicely on my kitchen counter and is very easy to operate...Definitely worth it for greater health.",2
5,and was relatively happy with it for the first year,16-Mar-15,Yes,"I purchased this blender under 2 years ago, and was relatively happy with it for the first year. Smoothie quality was very good - I used frozen fruit, ice cubes and various softer fruits and liquids.  It really makes smoothies, i.e. no grainy textures, even when using veggies with lots of fiber, like kale and spinach.  I use it 2-5x per week pretty continuously throughout the year. The last few months have been touch and go, as motor seemed to overheat quickly. Today it finally broke..I spoke with a Blentec rep, and we did some tests. Turns out the jar sealant got used up after so much use, and the base is still OK. Pfew. Plus since the equipment is under an 8 year warranty, I get a new upgraded jar for $20 + free shipping. Not bad. I have to say am fairly relieved, after reading horror stories online... And Blentec stands behind their products..Bottom line is, if you can afford it, it's a good blender for frozen drinks, hot soups and smoothies.",5
5,Use it everyday!,17-Mar-14,Yes,"I use a blender everyday and finally broke down and decided to pay more for one that was made for making all kinds of juices, soups  and smoothies instead of buying one every year that wasn't built for what I wanted.  I assumed I'd buy a VitaMix because  I just knew that was the best but then I realized it wouldn't fit under my counter and that Blendtec was getting all these great reviews so I went with it.  The shape and weight of the container allows for easy access of the contents and the best part is I  just punch a button and my smoothie goes through the process and shuts off. I've tried great new recipes from the cookbook included.  Personally, I think it's quieter than all the cheaper brands I used before and it's been worth every penny I've spent.",1
5,The best of the best and worth the $$$$,2-Oct-13,Yes,"I was hesitant to purchase this blender mostly because of the high price tag. But after trying to use some other, cheeper, and less than quality blenders and being frustrated with the results I finally took the plungs with the Blendtec and I do not regret it a bit. It performs with the highest ratings in every use I have put it through. It crushes ice almost as if it were butter. Smoothies come out perfectly blended evey time with no chunks of fruit left behind. I have made several other things in it as well like salsa and dips etc. Really love everything about it. It is a bit on the noisy side but things whip up so fast in it that the noise is not a bother.",3
1,Not worth the money,8-Oct-18,Yes,For the price didn?€?t blend very well I thought I was using a  cheap  blender Should be retested not worth the money,0
4,Very strong blender,6-Nov-10,Yes,I was hesitant when I saw the price of this blender. But it's worked perfectly now for over a year and I'm happy.  It is very strong and blends anything you throw in it.  Sometimes an air bubble will be created when you don't have enough liquid in the blender along with ice or frozen fruit but that is quickly cured by adding just a little more water or what ever.  I love this and have at lease one smoothie a day or more.  I've made ice cream in it too.  Highly recommend.  Four stars because of that air bubble I mentioned above.,3
5,Very well made and strong,28-Apr-18,Yes,"I was hesitant to spend this much on a blender, but wow, it's a monster. Crushes ice in a blink of an eye and has many presets that save time.",0
5,Excellent blender!,1-May-12,Yes,"This blender is amazing. I chose it over its competitor because it fits under kitchen cabinets and it is ridiculously easy to clean, literally it takes me 15 seconds or less to clean it. You just put 1 cup water with a little dish soap in the blender, pulse it, rinse and you are done! I have been using it daily and look forward to trying the different recipes described in the accompanying book. I am making lots of soups, no need to steam the veggies first, just chopp and dump in blender, hit ""soup"" and a few seconds later you have a smooth silky soup, it's super fast. Wish I had had it earlier..2/03/2015- Still loving it and using almost daily!",3
5,Awesome blender,18-Nov-18,Yes,"Awesome blender, works well. Little noisy and the pitcher seems to stain from food blending in it.",0
5,Excellent product,20-Sep-11,Yes,"I use this blender at least once a day to make green smoothies.  I tried making green smoothies with the cheap household blenders and there just isn't enough power to really pulverize the veggies and fruit.  From what I read, the Blendtec and the Vitamix are the only two blenders that can really do the job.  I have never used a Vitamix so I can't compare the two products, but I do know the Blendtec has exceeded all my expectations...Pros:.-Light weight.-Easy to clean.-Preset blending times.-Will blend anything.-Compact..Cons:.-The jar is kind of small.-Expensive..Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase.  Although the Blendtec is expensive, the health benefits of green smoothies are well worth the price tag.",4
5,"I love it, works great.. get the bigger JAR",10-Oct-12,Yes,"I like it when things are made to last.  I make 3 green smoothies every day and only eat one meat meal.  I do this every day for the last year, 900ish cycles...  It works so well..  My friends have used it and said they are trashing the old blender and buying a blendtec. I see these in use at starbucks and my health club cafe.  Get the bigger jar, YOU NEED THE BIGGER JAR!!!!!!!96oz JAR... just do it, go to youtube and look up the bigger Jar.",1
5,AWESOME,30-Jan-18,Yes,LOVE IT.  I USE IT TO MAKE SMOOTHIES WITH ALL THE FRUIT INCLUDING SEEDS.  IT HANDLES EVERYTHING.,0
5,Terrific Blender,22-Apr-13,Yes,"I bought this blender to make Green Drinks and so far it has been great.  I have been using this blender daily for a little over a month and half and I've had no problems with it at all.  There is a smoothie button on the machine, I press it and my drink is made in 60 seconds.  The motor changes speeds automatically.  My drinks come out as smooth as can be.  The container is easy to very clean - so that's a great thing.  I also feel that this is very important - because products that are hard to clean are usually just stored away and never used.  I am very happy with this purchase so far, and when I have time - I will start making soups, and use this blender for other purposes.  Gets a 5 in my opinion.  :)",2
5,recommended,9-Apr-16,Yes,this is the second one we purchased.  I had tried to save money buying a Ninja but it was a waste.  The blendtec turns lettuce into a creamy drink no chunks.  Compact but strong.  The company had great customer service when there was a problem,0
5,Great blender,8-Apr-18,Yes,Best blender I have ever owned! Liked it so much I had a friend in Culinary school get one too and she loves it also,0
5,Powerful machine!,2-Jun-14,Yes,"My nutritionist recommended this brand and I don't regret the investment at all! This machine runs on several levels so you can do a lot of different functions on it, but it's also powerful enough to puree an avocado pit - seriously, an avocado pit! Love, love, love it - it will last a long time and be a trusted tool for anyone doing juicing or raw smoothies.",0
1,"Overload error: the first day I used it, second blend. Booh!",28-Dec-17,Yes,"I made one smoothie (first use!) and when I tried my second one on the same day, I get the overload message. This happens on all programs even if I just use the pulse button to clean it with water. This is my first and last experience with blendtec. I am using a DASH Chef for 5 years now and although it is showing its age, it still works. I use it everyday twice a day and I blend big chunk of frozen fruits in it.",4

Sometimes I have to cycle through 3 or 4 ""smoothie"" button blend cycles to completely blend my smoothies.

5,Love my Blendtec but confused about warranty?!?!?!?,28-Jul-11,Yes,"Blender is awesome.  I use it daily.  Makes incredible smoothies...however I am totally confused about the warranty...The documentation says it comes with a 3 year warranty however the Blendtec website says it comes with a 7 year warranty.  I called Blendtec and the first customer service representative I spoke to told me since I purchased it at Amazon for $399 I would have to pay an additonal $39 to get the 7 year warranty???? She specifically asked me how much I paid for it and seemed to calculate the price of the 7 year warranty based on the price difference of the blender on their website.  This makes no sense to me.  If you buy from an authorized dealer you should get the same warranty no matter what price you pay. I called Blendtec again an got a different customer service rep who told me that starting in June all Blendtec Total Blenders had a 7 year warranty no matter where you purchased it.  So....I emailed Blendtec to get a 3rd opinion and was once again told it only had a 3 year warranty but I could extend it to 7 with a $39 extended warranty...Anyone else know what the ""real"" warranty is on this product? If there is this much confusion about the length of the warranty I dread ever having to use it...Has anyone else had conversations with Blendtec regarding their warranty when purchased from Amazon?",4
1,Received a refurbished unit,9-Sep-18,Yes,"I received a refurbished unit with No mixing Jar and a dirty lid, unacceptable",0
5,Use it for everything,12-Mar-13,Yes,"I use this for smoothies, soups, and even to mix ingredients for baking. Recently I boiled some turkey necks for my dog, but instead of picking out the meat, this time I just put the whole thing in the Blendtec and made her a turkey slush. I can grind up seeds and flax into flour as well. I'm very pleased. I also go the wildside option when Blendtec was giving them away as a special and I use that the most.",0

5,Love our Blendtec,6-Nov-13,Yes,"We've had our Blendtec for a few years now and have never had a problem with it. We use it mostly to make green smoothies and protein shakes, but sometimes baby food and food processing. I think it's definitely worth the money.",5
5,Exceeded expectations!!,3-Nov-11,Yes,"I didn't think these ""fancy"" blenders were worth the extra money, but boy was I wrong!  I can't believe how much better my smoothies are.  This Blendtec is amazing.  I just love it!!  Thank you Amazon, for making it affordable!  I'm eating tons of raw veggies...and enjoying it! And, by the way, its loud, but not that loud.

They come out nice and smooth and no big globs of anything.  I'm starting to get adventurous, as you can make sauces and soups in it as well.  The recipe book is great and gives you some awesome recipes, especially if you are looking to be more health conscience.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  It will pay for itself in no time.",2

4,Best blender I've ever had- With Service Update!,10-Jul-13,Yes,"There are plenty of other reviews so I'll try to make this different...The biggest problem with the blender is the speed control. It would be nice to have a dial..Next big-gy, is the lid. It leaks when over-filled. (Notice ""over-filled"").Next, smell (heavy duty motor has definite electrical smell).and finally the timer and program modes are hard to understand and remember...The Best thing about it is the scary power. It will eat or blend practically anything..I make ton's of creamy vegetable soups (daily). I usually use whole milk and drop in a bag of frozen veggies. It is done in 40 seconds. Very fast and easy..Easy cleanup. Rinse, squirt soap, shake and rinse and done..Great customer support. (Leaking lid was replaced immediately..(found out I was over-filling).7 year guarantee...SERVICE UPDATE- after a year of daily use my container started to leak at the bottom drive coupling. I tried to make sure I took care of it exactly as instructed. I called Blendtec up and had a replacement on the way in less than 2 minutes...I love the blender and the company's service.",3

5,Best blender money can buy,16-Feb-10,Yes,"This is the best blender money can buy. If you love preparing deserts, that blender will bring a quarter of whipping cream to a solid state in less than 5 seconds. You need to see it to believe. Besides, the ice cream and sorbet come out of that machine better than any you can buy at the grocery store.

5,Fantastic Blender,30-Sep-11,Yes,"like many reviews on here, i did exhaustive research on the blendtec and vitamix.  i chose the blendtec due to the larger horsepower and the ease of use.  if you load the blender right, you just hit smoothie, walk away, come back and you have a perfectly blended drink everytime.  another plus is that it's very easy to clean compared to other blenders (including vitamix).  i'm sure the vitamix is a boss machine too, but this blendtec is the boss hoss.  :",3
4,"seriously good blender, but for the $ it needs to be flawless",2-May-12,Yes,"I'm one of those people that usually has to learn something the hard way.  Blenders were no different, apparently.  I went through ""a few of them"", and luckily I was able to escape with my wallet relatively unscathed.  I didn't realize it at the time, but I was going to need that wallet.  Because what I needed out of a blender was apparently industrial strength.  I make smoothies like a lot of people, but for some reason the mix of ingredients I use invariably ""lets the smoke out"" of 99% of the blenders out there.  Now I'm a pretty simple person (if having to learn the hard way wasn't an anvil-shaped clue).  In my world, if I'm not blending rocks (if I'm actually blending something edible) then a normal blender should be able to...blend.  I don't know, maybe it's something about the name.  So after learning the hard way, it took some coaching to make the leap to an even-more-serious blender than I had tried before...and I had tried some blenders...To be honest, after going through all of those inferior blenders, the opinion only solidified more.  A blender should be able to blend.  So if you have to pay $400 for one, it better do it perfectly, and for a long time.  The choice for this model started with friends recommending it.  Then it was onto the ""Will it Blend"" videos.  They're pretty effective.  Especially the one where he blends cubic zirconians into dust.  I figured ""okay, if it'll do that it should handle my smoothies""...And it did, for the most part, and for a while.  One problem is with certain ingredients.  The unit will vibrate *very strongly* if you put certain food ingredients in together.  No, nothing extreme like the blend videos.  Normal food (okay, maybe ""tricky"" food).  A blender like this shouldn't vibrate enough for an owner to have to hold it down with both hands so it doesn't vibrate off the counter.  And there's apparently another problem when the unit vibrates with heavier-duty food ingredients in it--the digital display can flake out.  Just like mine did.  After over a year of use, the display lights up basically whenever it feels like it.  Yeah, that's not good...The other problem is the ""heavier food ingredients"" I mentioned.  In my case, it was a magic ratio of ice and...of all things...peanut butter.  Warm peanut butter is nothing, I can blend that with my eyes.  Cold peanut butter--made cold by ice especially--that's apparently a different story in the alternate universe of blending.  PB and ice is no synthetic diamond, but apparently it's up there.  With one blend, I could actually smell ionized air from the blender.  Of course I stopped it immediately.  And cursed at it to give me my money back...My final criticism (okay, no promises): the jar.  I was very careful when I made the move to buy this.  I read a *lot* of the reviews on here.  (Thanks for those by the way, and yes they really do help.)  One thing I saw a lot of was people complaining about the lifespan of the 2 quart jar.  Most of the problems seemed to be caused by dishwasher use.  Now for me, I'm thinking a $90 blend jar should be able to withstand a lifetime of dishwasher washes on heavy-duty wash using hot water and the strongest detergent you can get your hands on.  I sort of refuse to change my mind on that, $90 is a lot of money for questionable engineering.  I did manage to promise myself to only hand wash mine, though.  And I have.  It's been 14 months now.  I've always used regular dish soap, warm water, and my hand.  Seriously.  And after 14 months, about 15% of the gasket that marries the blade mechanism to the jar has 'particle-ized' and deposited itself in a ring around the jar's base that surrounds it and forms the 'feet' it sits on when it's on the blender.  And that material is apparently not optional because the blade is now noticeably harder to turn when you try to with your hand.  Uh yeah, this shouldn't be.  I don't know how much more life it has.  I do know I could not have babied it more.  And I know if it doesn't last at least another 10 months then what's wrong isn't how we treat them--it's how they're designed...Okay, enough of the criticism.  I'll give the Blendtec this--it is extremely powerful for an appliance that takes power from a normal wall outlet.  And it has blended some 250 44 oz smoothies (I do it in two 22oz batches, one after the other, so really it's 500 uses).  It only faulted twice (once when it ionized air, and again when the display developed a mind of its own).  That puts its performance in a world of its own.  If I had to bet, I'd bet this thing will last another 4 years.  And I understand who I am--I'm most likely a heavy-duty user...Still, if it doesn't last another 4 years I'm going to be getting on the phone with someone, and they're either going to correct the problem or I'm going to make my own video with my own blender, complete with its level of performance.  And then I'm going to turn right around and try the competition.  This is a seriously good blender for the money...but for the money we're talking about, we deserve excellence.",13

5,"after a year, it's still awesome",19-Jun-13,Yes,"After debating the Blendtec and Vitamix, I went with Blendtec because it's more compact and will not be a problem in a small apartment kitchen. I originally bought it because I wanted to stop spending so much money on green juice, but I have actually used it for so many other things that it's really more than paid for itself. Some people have said the Vitamix is better on soups but I've had nothing but great experiences using this to make blender-necessary soups like butternut squash. It handles hot liquids well. Blender will shift around if you overfill it (say, up to the line where the top of the blender widens), but otherwise, it will remain solid and stable while blending. The speeds on it are very useful. I have used this to blend nuts and it works great. I've used it for almond milk with wonderful results. It's very, very easy to clean and this is what makes it a real tool that you will use instead of just a fun toy.",1
5,I now blend daily,29-May-17,Yes,"Great blender. A bit loud, but it's a high powered blender so its to be expected.",0

4,Great blender!,17-Jul-16,Yes,"I run a small business. We use Vitamix in our shop &amp; I have been curious to try the Blendtec. When amazon offered this one on prime the deal was too good to pass up! I have been using it at home. At first I wasn't impressed but it just took some getting used to. Once I figured out all the settings &amp; what worked best with what I was blending it works great! The only real issue I have had which isn't so much an issue as just annoying is sometimes the container doesn't want to fit back on. It just about having the teeth on the mechanism lined up, so at home its no big deal other then annoying. If I was using it in the shop though it would be really annoying because it takes more time. Other then that little thing though, its been pretty great.  Also, before I bought it I read a lot of the reviews. It seems that most of the things people have complained about have been fixed because I haven't seen or had issues with any of the complaints. Good buy!",2
5,"Yes, it's expensive but, worth it!",19-Mar-13,Yes,"This blender is awesome! After plenty of research we decided on the Blendtec. It pulverizes even the tiniest of seeds (this is great, since I like putting frozen blackberries and rasberries in my smoothies)...Yes, it's a bit noisy, but it's too terrible...We use it for green smoothies, using the entire fruit and vegetables - including beets!",0

5,so far so good,23-May-14,Yes,"Only used it about 5 times so far but couldn't be happier. Works well and cleanup is easy. The only time it had trouble with items getting stuck was when I had it overfilled, and then just running the Smoothie cycle a 2nd time fixed it.",0
5,Five Stars,19-Mar-18,Yes,Great value!,0
5,Why didn't I buy this sooner???,24-Mar-13,Yes,"I'm loving this new blender!  I grew frustrated with my old blender which took 1-2 minutes to make my morning smoothie, whereas this blender finishes in 40 seconds. Very effectively crushes ice to be one like know if you use the full cycle!",0
5,Perfect!!!,23-Jan-18,Yes,This was exactly what we were looking for and at an amazing price.,0
5,Makes Smoothies With Ease,13-May-08,Yes,"The last two blenders we've owned, a KitchenAid and a Braun, have both broken.  They each used some form of plastic-like transmission devices to get the power from the motor to the carafe, and with both, teeth started breaking off during blending, usually while making things with frozen fruit...I'd read many reviews of this blender, as well as watching the food-oriented videos, along with the comedic 'Will It Blend' videos on the manufacturer's site.  While frightfully expensive, it seemed as though the Total Blender could deliver.  I ordered one for my wife as an anniversary present.  (Romantic, eh?)..This blender works as advertised.  We use it primarily to make smoothies, which we each do almost every day.  Usually we start by filling the carafe up about halfway with a handful or two of spinach along with maybe 8 oz. of water, and then pulse for a few seconds.  This turns into a little more than a cup of soupy green goo.  If you don't liquefy the spinach first, it's volume-eating leafy form will take up too much space in the jar and you won't be able to add as much fruit.  So after the spinach, I just open the fridge and start dumping things in.  A typical mix would be something like half a cup of yogurt, a cup or two of frozen fruit and a banana.  In about 20 seconds you've got a perfectly blended drink containing most of day's supply of fruits and veggies.  Even if you're bad and end up eating like crap the rest of the day, at least you got a good start...It is very loud, as others have mentioned, but I don't know how it could do what it does and still be quiet.  It's got a big motor under that hood.  The other slight annoyance is that they say it's only top rack dishwasher safe, but obviously there are no dishwashers with a top rack big enough to hold anything that big.  They did say it was because of the heating element, so maybe if you use a no-heat dry cycle it'd be ok.  I tend to use the blend-soap-and-water cleaning method, and then scrub by hand every few days...All around this is a great product, and if you're looking for a serious blender it will satisfy your needs.",29
5,Awesome Kitchen Aid,5-Jun-11,Yes,"Incredibly easy to use.  Light-weight with MIGHTY POWER.  Takes up very little counter space.  Makes the best, creamiest smoothies imaginable including recipes that call for a whole avocado seed!!!! And the biggest plus in my opinion:  totally easy to clean:-).  As usual, Amazon.com provides me with great service.",1

4,Anything Better Than A Blendtec?,21-Dec-14,Yes,"There are many reviews on the Blendtec and how it compares to Vitamix and other blenders. So I won't go into detail about this blender.  Let me say simply that I have one.  My 2 daughters have one.  My niece has one.  My sister has one.  A couple of us has had the Blendtec for a few years.  None of us have any complaints.  Nor have any of us had any negative experiences with it.  Well, my one daughter did try to blend some frozen fruit that wasn't quite willing to be blended and proceeded to crack the jar, consequently.  But one can't really blame the Blendtec for that..The only reason I give a 4-star hinges on the fact that I have never had a blender of this caliber with which to compare it.  There could be a better blender out there, but the Blendtec is good enough for me.",1
5,Five Stars,14-Oct-16,Yes,very good,1

5,Absolutely phenomenal blender!,17-Sep-12,Yes,"This Blendtec blender has worked wonders for my wife and me.  We've made smoothies, both fruit and vegetable juice, icing for cake, etc.  With such a high powered motor it can actually make soup... and heat it up!..With this blender you will be set to go.  You really don't need any extra appliances that do similar functions... this does it all!",0
5,A purchase you won't regret,14-Jul-13,Yes,So glad I splurged on this kitchen appliance.  I use it so often that it occupies a prominent place on my counter.  Most often used for making smoothies and homemade almond butter.  Love the smooth consistency of everything I blend in it.  It is powerful!,0

Tried a few recipes in the book and was totally amazed at how efficient and easy it was to use.  I've been through many a ""blender"" in my lifetime and finally hit on the one I'm sure will last me for many years to come.  Thank you Blendtec!",2

5,Great blender,21-Aug-12,Yes,The recipe book that comes with the blender is great and shows us the tip of the iceberg for what we will be able to do with the blender. It is easy to clean and is not too big to store on the counter. The 7 year warranty is very reassuring when buying an appliance. The cost will be worth it when we benefit with better health because of the foods we can prepare.,0
5,Awesome blender,10-Feb-14,Yes,Very powerful. Blendtec is great because they have awesome customer service. I would definitely recommend this product. I use it all the time for my shakes.,0
5,I wasn't looking for a blender!,18-Apr-13,Yes,"I was sitting at the computer in my office doing some research. Bored, I turned on the TV. The show was ""Modern Marvels"", the subject was the Blendtec manufacturing process and its final products. I watched in fascination, especially as the products were torture tested by the manufacturer. They pulverized a cellphone in this thing!! It's got a 3HP electric motor and fits in a small space on your counter-top...I figured this would be a quick and simple way to expand my range of diet. All ya' gotta do is grind it up and drink it, right? I did some research and discovered that the Blendtec will sit on the counter and fit under the kitchen cabinets. Some competitors will not fit under your cabinets...they are too big...Well I ordered it and have used it nearly every day for the past 3 months. I love it. It comes with a very good book of recipes and tips on blending. You might well be surprised at how tasty some fruit and vegetable combinations can be. Personally, I never thought I'd be drinking fresh spinach and enjoying it. But I do! I use this as a meal replacement. And did I mention that it's quick and easy? If you can peel a banana you can use this blender. It's THAT quick and easy...If I had it to do over, I'd buy it again, without hesitation.",3

5,Perfect,12-Jan-13,Yes,"This is great, and does what I need it to do. When making my green smoothie every morning the consistency is smooth the kale and spinach is completely blended and no chunks are left. It is very noisy especially in the morning but it does not bother me and cleaning is very easy. I purchased this instead of the Vitamix because it is shorter and fits on my kitchen counter... No regrets so far",0
5,Best Decision,7-Oct-13,Yes,"A friend turned me onto the Blendtec, it has been incredible.  It changed the way I eat and feel.  I throw Carrots, Kale, Spinach, Red Pepper, Apple, Strawberries, Banana and water in and whip together.  No more salads, just protein for dinner.  Smoothie during the day.",1
5,Five Stars,16-Dec-15,Yes,Best blender you can buy! You won't regret it,0
5,"Blendtec TB-621-20 Total Blender, Black",30-Dec-12,Yes,I like its action of grasping all the ingredients by its own action and blending them.  I had wanted the larger jar which I thought I was getting when I ordered it.  That one came with the 4 inch blade.  I did recommend it to someone and she bought one also.  She bought the one with the larger jar.  It is a great addition to my kitchen.,0

5,LOVE this machine,31-Mar-15,Yes,LOVE this machine.  It is a true powerhouse.  It can turn ice cubes into snow literally in seconds.  Well worth the price.,2
5,"Finally, A Blender That Works Great with Little Effort!",29-Jan-16,Yes,We've used the Blendtec Blender for about a month. It works great--better than other blenders we have used. The settings on the various buttons make blending so simple. I highly recommend this blender.,0
5,Top Quality Blender,6-Jun-13,Yes,You can't go wrong with this blender.  We use it every day and it works perfect every time.  Easy clean up and it fits under your cabinets.  We mainly use it for green smoothies.,2
5,Great so far,11-Dec-16,Yes,Great so far! This machine desintegrates anything you put inside. Is not as noisy as I expected for that size of motor. We're using it pretty much daily. Very satisfied.,0
5,"Pricey, but worth it !",15-Feb-13,Yes,"This is the best blender we have owned.  It is sturdy and easy to use.  Very good quality and the company is great to deal with...Just after the container went out of warranty, it started making a funny noise.  I called the company, anyway and a very professional lady told me what to do - to start it, and hold the phone so she could listen.  She said, it was not working properly and she would send a new one.  A few days after that, a new container arrived and it has worked perfectly since...Using this to make fresh juice is wonderful and amazing.  You get ALL the nutrition, you want from the fruit or vegetables!  In most 'juicers', all the pulp/fiber and those nutrients go out the back and you only get the juice.  With the Blendtec, you can put in the whole apple (cut into large chunks), seeds and all and you get apple juice !  Tasty and full of all the wonderful stuff from nature.  It grinds it so fine that you do not know there are seeds, or core or skin in the juice.  If, for some reason, yours is not fine enough, just run it, again...With this, you can make coffee drinks that have true ice crystals like the Star---- brand.  You can make ice cream and hot soups, from quality ingredients...Many people are into ""green"" drinks and whole foods.  Others try, but don't like the taste.  Well, you can put in Avacado, fresh spinach, blueberries, cucumbers, strawberries, etc and it will taste like a berry drink !  The colors might not be totally green, but the taste is really good.  There are plenty of recipes out there, and after a while you learn to come up with your own...I would highly recommend this Blender.",6
5,Like it,6-Mar-17,Yes,Working good so far.  Much better than our other one.  Not very much louder than our other blender.  I expect blenders to be somewhat loud though.  Cleaning the jar is not very difficult.  We mainly use the blender to make smoothies.  Happy so far.  We have not experienced any problems so far with the seal that others have stated.  Also we don't use our blender daily.,2

The daily smoothies have most certainly improved my diet and overall health.  I highly recommend this machine over the competition.,1
5,Simplicity for good eating.,11-Jul-10,Yes,This blender is so easy to use and clean.  That is my reason for purchasing this product..I have some health problems from not eating correctly.

5,Great product,26-Oct-16,Yes,"I regret having bought so many cheaper blenders in the past. This is of course pricey but it does the job so well. I imagine having this last for another 10-15 years and it is totally worth the money! Love all the different settings that it has (smoothie, ice cream, soup, batter and some more). It also keeps a count of all the blending done so far. I am a techie and I love the little technical nuances of this blender! Super easy to clean with Pulse!",2

Hers arrived yesterday and a few pixels are dead on the display. Mine arrived today and the blender jar leaks on the bottom on first use. Thought maybe I made a mistake so dried it all off and tried again with only 16 ounces of water in it. This time it leaked even faster!..Two defects in two days on two blenders of this price is absolutely inexcusable. Mine is going back and I will just use my cheap blender that has never leaked.

She's very happy with it, and I must admit the smoothies are ... well, smooth.  No chunks and if you watch it, it does this pretty cool cyclone effect that other blenders are surely jealous of.  Bottom line, it does an awesome job at blending things, and an equally awesome job at waking the entire household up when my wife runs it at 6AM.  *grumble*..Would have recieved 5 stars if it were more quiet.

The next time we used it to make a vanilla milkshake the whole think just melted with bits of plastic everywhere including in the drink! Blendtec were very difficult to deal with. I would have expected not just a refund but a new machine and a courtesy call as to what happened with the unit. As it stood, they just picked up the machine and refunded the unit. No explanation. I don't feel comfortable with a company who behaves this way with a machine which smoked up and shot shards of plastic everywhere. Someone could have gotten hurt.

The old one still works, although making a different sound, so we are saving it as a back up.  We once had a Vitamix  but it was too tall to fit under our kitchen cabinets.

The square jar sucks, don't buy any unit that doesn't come with the wildside jar...Frankly, with these jars wearing out so fast and at these prices, Blendtec should offer a lifetime warranty on the machine just to get us to keep buying jars...UPDATE 3/7/2013 (See below about the jars):..I ponied up another $450 to buy a new designer series with a 7-year warranty. Didn't want to bother with Costco, which offers 8 years!..The new one is slick, with a very nice control panel. I got it with the big jar, and I noticed with the small jar it makes 3 times the noise! Seriously, do not buy with the small jar!..I use this thing many times a day, and I though that the jar had gone out already after just a few months. I called Blendtec and they sent a new one. Turns out that the jar is fine, it was just a little water dripping on the machine and getting sucked in under the jar due to the high speed...IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE JARS: Be sure to clean the jar with soapy water at high-speed blend for maximum life. According to the Blendtec engineer I spoke with, sugars can speed deterioration of the rubber seal. See below for more update info...The bottom line? Don't get this version, buy the Designer series. For $50 bucks it is worth it. Take care of your jar correctly, and then it is a good deal if you use it a lot...UPDATE AGAIN April 7, 2013:.The run count on the new blender is already almost 600. That is because I use it a lot and I wash it every time. However, I do not use soapy water every time, and now I never fill it more than 1/3 with soapy water...SOAPY WATER WARNING: Never fill more than 1/3 with soapy water! The lid blew off and sent soapy water into my cups full of smoothie, and drowned many cardboard packages on the counter top, and finally soaked the wall behind the counter. Although they redesigned the lid to have a large opening to prevent blow-ups, soapy water can produce so many bubbles that they can't get through the opening fast enough! This blended soapy water is great for washing dishes, by the way. It looks like high-quality Italian frothed milked, ready to make a top-flight cappuccino!",58

5,Awesome blender that will blend anything,10-Jan-13,Yes,I use this to make smoothies for my mornings. This thing will obliterate anything your put in there and come out great. The fibre glass jug is really easy to clean and looks like it will last a long time,0
5,Blends everything,6-Mar-13,Yes,My first blender over $20 and i must say I am super happy with it. I have made everything from yummy shakes to bland veggie drinks and more. IT WILL BLEND...It cleans super easy and you can put the jar on top of the machine to dry (doesn't take up dish pan space!)..It will get loud when ice is in it or when the motor really speeds up. (think jamba juice sounds),1

5,"Blendtec TB-621-20 1,560-Watt Total Blender, Black",6-Apr-11,Yes,"This blender is quite pricey, but its worth the money! It blends anything! It even knows when to stop blending. My mom loves it. I think its a great house warming gift.",0
5,exactly what i wanted,18-Feb-10,Yes,"if i were oprah, i would buy this blender for everyone i know. it does what it is supposed to do. its easy to clean. the same blenders are used at starbucks and jamba juice.(I did not know this when i purchased it, but like recognizing the familiar purr of a certain car, i can hear the blendtec motor whilst waiting in line)..its awesome. i love it.",2
5,Better than Expected,10-Jun-13,Yes,"Perfect 5 star rating, this blender is amazing.  The performance really does justify the price...This is a great purchase.",0
5,Love it!,18-Dec-12,Yes,Works Great! We highly recommend it. Love that you don't loose all the fiber like you do with some other juicers.,0
5,Wow!,21-Sep-07,Yes,This blender is phenominal. It'll grind up anything you can throw at it. We grind up wheat to make fresh whole wheat bread. Mmm! My wife likes to make veggie/fruit juices and we make baby food for our 6 month old. It's loud but the clean-up is extremely easy. You'll be happy with this blender.,13
5,love my blendtec,18-Jul-11,Yes,"Have been using for about a week. Did take a little getting used to. Love the pulse button, anything frozen, we pulse it first to break it up a bit. A little loud but expected that after reading other reviews. Have done carrots, apples, cucumbers, spinach, and all kinds of other fruits. I feel healther already.",2
5,The best blender made!,10-Jul-16,Yes,"What an appliance this is!  The BendTech blender is so powerful!  Hubby said he's never heard of a 3hspwr appliance, but seeing it make SNOW out of big ice cubes, in mere seconds,  is proof of its power.  What quality- made in Utah (not China or Japan)!  Love this blender!",1
5,Five Stars,30-Aug-15,Yes,Excellent,0
5,Will it blend? Yes,22-Jan-13,Yes,I was on the fence about weather to buy this or a vitamix. I ultimately went with the Blendtec because it was more compact. It has lived up to my every expectation.,0
5,the quintessential blender,2-Aug-07,Yes,"indeed the price tag is a bit steep, but don't let that dissuade you. i previously owned a high end kitchenaid and while it was not bad, i still had to rock it back and forth, especially when making frozen drinks. after seeing vitamix demos at sam's club and hearing rave reviews about the blendtec, i finally decided to research the two. i'm so glad that i went with the blendtec...i use it 6 days a week on average for a variety of things, including making smoothies, grinding flaxseed, making dips, blending soups...the list goes on and on. overall, i have been very happy with my purchase.  while it is not perfect, i highly recommend it.",13
5,Makes amazing green smoothies and I feel fantastic!,18-Jun-13,Yes,"I got this after my magic bullet died after I made green smoothies on it. I throw in big chunks of carrots, apples, frozen pineapple, frozen mango, whatever I want, and I pack it right up to the top with kale and spinach, and it blends it to perfect smoothness. So good for you and makes me feel fantastic.",1
5,Full POWER!,15-Jan-17,Yes,"I'm no kitchen expert or smoothie making champion but i REALLY enjoy this Blendtec blender..this blender seems to be able to chew through anything you put into it! no bogging down, no needing to shake to releive air pockets, no missed chunks. The blender can be very loud so that could not be good for some people but it will chew through anything you put in it so im not going to complain.",0
5,terrific product. Easy to use and clean,29-Oct-15,Yes,terrific product.  Easy to use and clean.,0
